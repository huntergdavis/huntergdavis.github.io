Easy Kitty Censor is a fast and free application which allows you to censor your photographs using a kitty picture. Simply select your kitty size, select a photo, and click anywhere you want to place a kitty.

You can then save your censored photos for uploading to social networks etc. It’s also great for making meme images, or when you just want a kitty in your photo! I guarantee it’s the most fun you’ll ever have censoring a photograph!
