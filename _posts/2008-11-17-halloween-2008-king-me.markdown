Ok so hereâ€™s a hilarious photo from Halloween 2008. If you like it as much as I did, feel free to buy a mug at my [cafepress store](http://www.cafepress.com/hunterdavis). I make no profit from anything sold, just the thought of that photo being out there is hilarity itself. [King Me!](http://66.147.244.180/~hunterda/content/images/2008/11/theking1.png "King Me!")
