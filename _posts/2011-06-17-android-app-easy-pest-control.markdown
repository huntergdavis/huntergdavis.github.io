Easy Pest Control is a fast and free app designed to repel the most common types of pests. With the press of a button you can dispel mosquitos, rats, mice, and cockroaches. Easy Pest Control is based on a combination of proven ultrasonic technology and bimodal sinusoidal audio. In this way pests which have become accustomed to standard untrasonic repellants are also repelled. This specific combination of frequencies cause the pests discomfort, but in a humane way.
