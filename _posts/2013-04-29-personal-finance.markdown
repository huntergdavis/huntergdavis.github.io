As of May 1st, 2013 I am undertaking a new financial endeavor. You can read all about it in [this blog post](http://www.hunterdavis.com/2013/04/28/lifestyle-are-your-personal-tastes-a-sound-investment-strategy-wherein-i-create-the-only-pay-yourself-strategy/). To summarize:

*From this point forward, I’m only going to purchase products from corporations I own a part of.*

I call it the “Only Pay Yourself” strategy (OPY). The theory is this, if you’re going to pay a corporation for their goods and services, then it makes sense that you’d believe in their quality and long term viability.

One of the question’s I’m trying to answer is: Is this inherent belief in the worth of a product or service useful in a market strategy?

You can view the rolling purchase log for my OPY stock purchases at the [OPY Purchase Log Page](http://www.hunterdavis.com/personal-finance/only-pay-yourself-purchase-log/).
