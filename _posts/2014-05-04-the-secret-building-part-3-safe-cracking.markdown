After [part 1](http://www.hunterdavis.com/2014/04/26/the-secret-building-part-1-thats-no-berry-bush/)(the unveiling) and [part 2](http://www.hunterdavis.com/2014/04/28/the-secret-building-part-2-with-video-holy-crap-theres-stuff-in-it/) (the opening of the secret building), there was only one major mystery left on my new property: what was in the locked safe? That mystery has now been solved. Read on for part 3 of my trilogy of mystery: Safe-cracking!

[![hammer time](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_175138-225x300.jpg)](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_175138.jpg)

For those unfamiliar with the tale, I found a locked safe in the house I just purchased. I checked under the safe and with a little bit of looking around I found where the safe had been screwed into a not-so-sturdy piece of plywood underneath a drawer in the upstairs bathroom. So I unscrewed the safe, and brought it into my garage to disassemble.

Some helpful redditors had suggested I simply take a sawzall and cut away the door. As I don’t have a sawzall and wasn’t keen to purchase one, I decided to see what I could do with a sturdy hammer, a small pry-bar, and a screwdriver.

[![safe pins](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_173740-225x300.jpg)](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_173740.jpg)

First came the door hinges. They were covered by small caps. These were a quick hammer away from destruction. Next were the pins, which also fell to a few sharp blows from my hammer.

Next came the outer door assembly. I used the pry-bar to get an edge up and just started hammering on the corner for a while.

It was fairly cheap metal, and was no match for my hammer.

There was concrete inside the safe (likely for fire-proofing.) Good thing I was wearing a filtered mask and safety goggles.

I used a large screwdriver and the hammer to slowly bend the inner metal of the door away from the lock assembly.

Finally, I saw what I was looking for. The lock assembly connected to a thick metal bar which sat inside the upper lip of the safe.

A few choice hits with the hammer began to bend the metal and knocked out the lock assembly.

A little pry-bar action allowed the corners to be bent inward.

A quick tap with the hammer onto a thick screwdriver placed behind the metal bar allowed the lip to bend outward and the door to fall off.

[![locking bar](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_175903-300x225.jpg)](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_175903.jpg)

The door.

[![the door](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_175927-225x300.jpg)](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_175927.jpg)

And what was in the safe?

[![inside the safe](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_175936-300x225.jpg)](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_175936.jpg)

Let’s see, there’s a little metal separator.. and some paper. It’s a note! Is it a secret treasure map? The words that will unmake the universe? The hope left at the bottom of Pandora’s box?

[![IMG_20140503_180011](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_180011-300x225.jpg)](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_180011.jpg)

Nope, it’s (no irony lost here…) the warranty information for the safe. Upon closer inspection there’s an address and a name on the paper. And that name?

[![the note](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_180016-300x225.jpg)](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2014/05/IMG_20140503_180016.jpg)

Oh yes, that’s Fred Meyer (the grocery store where the safe was purchased.)

So in the end, the only thing I found in the safe was irony, and perhaps a bit of closure.
