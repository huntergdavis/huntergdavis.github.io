Super simple rss is a program designed to make the creation and editing of rss feeds easier for new users. It has since been taken over by a group over at sourceforge. Grab the latest version at [ssrss.sourceforge.net](http://ssrss.sourceforge.net)

Update 4/2012 My original source and project is now also hosted on GitHub. Check it out at [my GitHub page](https://github.com/huntergdavis).
