Feeling Paranoid? Easy Encrypted Journal encrypts each journal entry with a separate AES encryption password, so you can be extra certain your journal entries are safe.

Normal journal applications store your entries in plaintext within a database that could be accessible to other programs. Easy Encrypted Journal stores all entries as encrypted cypher hashes that would take supercomputers many years to crack.
