One of the more popular programs I released around 3 years ago, this one made it to the big-time. Magazines, download sites, and advertising revenue! SSRSS allows you to easily create and edit rss files.

Development of SSRSS has been taken over by a group of enterprising programmers at sourceforge. [Go check out their site and the current state of SSRSS here](http://ssrss.sourceforge.net "sourceforge hosted ssrss").
