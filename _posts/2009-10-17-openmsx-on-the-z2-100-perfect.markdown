Busy busy as always, but still trying new packages as they catch my eye. Not that anyone is surprised at what the Z2 can do after seeing Full Throttle running, but for the MSX lovers out there openMSX runs at 100% speed with sound etc etc. ![openmsx](http://66.147.244.180/~hunterda/content/images/2009/10/PIC_00111.jpg)  
  
 Just apt-get install openmsx, and run it once with a rom. Exit out, then edit the ~/.openMSX/share/settings.xml and set your scale factor to one. I found a sample config file on the net [here ](http://www.msx.org/forumtopic6031.html)that worked well.  
 That will set the output to 320Ã—240, looks and runs great.
