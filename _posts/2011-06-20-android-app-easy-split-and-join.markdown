Easy File Split and Join is a fast and free app to split or join files. This is especially useful for sending file attachments, recombining files downloaded in parts, and getting around file size limitations. It is opimized for writing very large files even on devices with very low memory.

Anecdotally, joining a 400 megabyte matroska video file took 50 seconds on my Viewsonic Gtablet.
