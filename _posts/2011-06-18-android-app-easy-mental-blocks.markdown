Easy Mental Blocks is a fast and free application for mind-mapping, getting things done, to-do lists, application and route planning and so much more. It is phenomenally different from any app which Iâ€™ve previously done, combining my favorite parts of a wiki and a to-do list in an intuitive way. You can read all about it [here](http://hunterdavis.com/android-app-easy-mental-blocks).
