For those of you who have picked up a tablet, but have yet to pick up a nice case, here is a quick hack for you. I’ve taken a paper feed tray, a PCI slot cover, and a standard dell usb keyboard and screwed them all together. I covered all the screw heads and rough edges with hot glue, and I sit here now typing a comfortable 80+wpm on my tablet. As I’m running a kernel that supports USB host mode on my GTablet, I simply plugged it in via USB and found a way to attach the tablet to the back of a keyboard (screws and hot glue). Fun, and it works great!
