Custom Comets is a fast and free game for the Android. Comets will come rushing at you, and it’s your job to shoot them. With classic arcade gameplay, a reversible firing mode, and the ability to load your own comet images, Custom Comets will keep you coming back for more time and again. The “Me Gusta” and “Problem?” memes from Reddit are used as the default comet and player images.
