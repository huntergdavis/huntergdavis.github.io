Yeah, more technically itâ€™s a 20-watt x264 player. But itâ€™s an 800mhz CELERON (all caps!) pumping 1080p into a broadcom decoder. More info after the jump

 I bought an 50$ 2g surf on ebay that was missing a screen. Thereâ€™s not that many ways you can upgrade this machine, itâ€™s only got 256 megs of ram soldered onto the board, and the system bus is extra slow. But the wifi chipset is mini-pci, so I replaced the wifi with a bcm decoder 70012 chip. I also picked that up from ebay hong kong (20$), and installed xbmc on xp-nlite to fit on the 2 gigabyte ssd also soldered onto the board. The 800mhz celeron and slow system bus donâ€™t seem to want to play most 1080p vids, without stuttering, but most 720p runs fine. So I can rip my blue-ray to standard x264, throw it on a thumb drive and play it anywhere thatâ€™s got a vga connector. And it only uses 20 watts. And itâ€™s throwing up 720p and completely powering those speakers and the os and the ssd and usb stick itâ€™s reading from. 15 watts while booting. You could probably do that with a hand dynamo. Which Iâ€™ll probably try to set up with a usb powered pico projector in the near future. Thatâ€™ll be the next vid perhaps? ðŸ™‚ Gotta love ebay./
