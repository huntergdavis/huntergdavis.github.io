So I was updating my 3d impress.JS resume, and I thought I’d put some QuickGrapher graphs in there.  Turns out it’s easy as pie to embed QuickGrapher graphs in an impress.JS presentation, and the results are [pretty neat](http://hunterdavis.com/resume/#/quickgrapher2).

A still photo, for those of you just skimming.
