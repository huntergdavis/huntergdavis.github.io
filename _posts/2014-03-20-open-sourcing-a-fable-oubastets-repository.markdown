I wrote a fable when I awoke this evening. It wasn’t perfect, but it’s out there and I like it. How then, will I track and improve it, sharing it with others? How would we know fables if they had not been shared? Where will our new fables come from? So I’m open-sourcing my fable. Your move Peter Molyneux.
