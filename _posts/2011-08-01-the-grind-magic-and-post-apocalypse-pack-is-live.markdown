The Grindâ€™s first Expansion Pack is out! This first Expansion Pack is titled Magic and Post-Apocalypse Pack and it is live right now! This will be automatically updated through the Android Market. It implements some of the most often requested player features (saves based on player names, auto-grinding without touching), as well as adds hundreds of new spells, locations, enemies, items, and more! You can also now view your current spell and item lists from the menu button!
