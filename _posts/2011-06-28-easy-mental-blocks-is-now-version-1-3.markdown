Easy Mental Blocks has now been updated to Version 1.3. Due to an increase in popularity for this app in the Korean market as well as a personal request from a user (Thanks Ahsen), significant feature improvements have been made. New to this version is a set of ellipsis buttons next to each block. Simply click the ellipsis to view or enter a full page of text to be associated with that block. This greatly increases the amount of information you can associate with each block, and is handy for using Easy Mental Blocks as a wiki or database type application.
