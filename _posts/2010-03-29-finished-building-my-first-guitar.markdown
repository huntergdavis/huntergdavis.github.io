Mark brought over his copy of Make, and it turns out this last Makezine had a [great article](http://makezine.com/04/cigarbox/) on building [cigar box guitars](http://cigarboxguitars.com/). It sounded like a really interesting project, so we went off to the hardware store to purchase some oak timber. Many days/hours/blood stains later, the fruits of our labor emerged, tuned and ready to play. ![cigar box guitar](http://www.hunterdavis.com/guitar.jpg) . Lots of hack potential, and an easy fix if I break something. Bonus, tablature looks fine in links browser on the Z2, though you will have to scroll quite a lot. I’ll see about getting gnome guitar working, should be interesting (mono bleh). Yet again another use case for the Z2 I wouldn’t have imagined.
