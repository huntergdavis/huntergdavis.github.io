Easy Graph Paper is a fast and free way to generate graph paper images on the go. You can use these for graphics development or print them out for use as real graph paper.

Update – As of October 2013 I’ve released version 2.

This includes colored lines and image backgrounds! The GitHub repository has been updated with this new code as well.

You can adjust the resolution and graph density of your graph paper, then save it out for later use!
