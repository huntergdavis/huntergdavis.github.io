I’ve written a number of open source projects over the years, with many more on the way. All of my Android apps and games are open source, as are the fruits of my previous start-up Discursive Labs. Here are a few of the ones that became popular over the years.

Check out a great deal of my open source projects at [my GitHub page](https://github.com/huntergdavis).
