Easy File Encrypt is a fast and free app which allows you to encrypt and decrypt files on the go! Set your own AES cypher password, and your file will be encrypted. Now no-one can decrypt the file without knowing the password!

Update 8/23/2011 – It turns out there are a number of phones that this program will not work for without significant re-writes for each model. As I am running short on time I’m afraid I’m going to have to pull this app from the store for now, as I can’t ethically have a product on the market that doesn’t always work as advertised. Anyone who wants a copy can get one from me personally, but for the time being development on Easy File Encrypt has stopped.

Update – Batch Mode has been added! Batch encrypt/decrypt any number of files.
