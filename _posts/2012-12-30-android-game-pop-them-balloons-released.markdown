Pop Them Balloons! – The first game from the 5-Seconds mini-game and article series compilation has been released on the Google Play store. You can download it (for free) [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hunterdavis.popthemballoons). This may take up to a full day from this posting to reach your particular Play market, so if you don’t see it on your Play market, be sure to check back later this evening!

Pop Them Balloons! is a casual game where you try to pop a certain number of different colored balloons within a time limit.

I feel this is a fair compromise, especially since everything about the game is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/huntergdavis/PopThemBalloons) and free for you to use however you like.
