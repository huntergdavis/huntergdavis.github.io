Part of any pastime is accepting the risks associated with that activity. For long-boarding commuters like myself, the primary risk is falling face forward if your board gets caught on something. This can happen at any time, for any number of reasons. This means that if you’re not wearing your gloves (even on a short trip to the store), your hands are going to get effed up something fierce.

Meta #1: It’s hard to type naturally without my palms feeling.. “sticky” with blood. Gross  
 Meta #2: Remember when I said that I’ve given up posting to social media directly, you’re likely to see shorter, more frequent updates here on the site? This post would definitely fall under that category.
