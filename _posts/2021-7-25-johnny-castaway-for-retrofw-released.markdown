Johnny Castaway for for RetroFW is now released!  This is the firmware running on all your favorite Chinese handheld devices.  Things  like the LDK game, RG-300, RS97, etc.  It is based on my SDL 1.2 port of the engine, and seems to work really well. 


You can find the .ipk file to install [here](https://github.com/huntergdavis/jc_reborn/blob/sdl_12_retrofw/bin/johnny.ipk)

There are also a few half-working ports in the above directory, xbox, embedded systems, etc.  Having a lot  of fun making sure Johnny runs everywhere :)
