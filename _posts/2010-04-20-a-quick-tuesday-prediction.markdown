Being capitalists, Microsoft will shortly roll out a buyback program for downloaded Xbox Live arcade games. Games can be “returned” for 1000 Microsoft points, with the caveat that if you want to re-download the game, it will cost you full price. Corollary prediction, they will make money hand over fist. That is all.
