title: Live Web Strobe Tuner is Live Now!

The culmination of a great deal of hard work has just been pushed live to the web, and the marketing push will begin.  I am very proud of what I accomplished, and the lengths Miso Media (my former employers) allowed me to push the boundaries of their web strategy.  This is a fantastic piece of technology, and will hopefully be the basis for a great deal of future products and web items.  It should easily integrate into any audio processing system, is portable to essentially any device, and should be standards compliant for many years.  It’s been tested to work on Chrome and Firefox for Mac, Linux, and Windows and requires the Flash plugin for audio input.  (Sadly there is just no getting around this requirement until browsers get with the HTML5 audio program).

Check it out on the [official Miso Media Tuner page](http://www.misomedia.com/tuner/).
