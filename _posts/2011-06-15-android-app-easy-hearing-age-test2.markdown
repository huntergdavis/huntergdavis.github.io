Easy Hearing Age Test is a fast and free app to determine your “Hearing Age”. As we age, our hearing deteriorates and we are no longer able to hear certain high frequencies. This program tests for the highest frequency you are still able to hear, and returns your “Hearing Age” from this (also known as a high frequency response test). It also allows you to generate frequencies that you specify.
