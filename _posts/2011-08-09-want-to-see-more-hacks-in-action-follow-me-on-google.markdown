I never quite got into Twitter. The value proposition just wasn’t there for me and it always seemed like a passing thing. Google+ on the other hand has already given me infinite photo storage, I can put animated gifs in my stream (oh the opportunity for last-frame gif bombs!), and I can choose exactly what messages go out to which subscribers based on circles. So I’m on Google+, and that’s where I post a good chunk of my smaller hacks and tidbits of life. Want to know what I’ve been up to between posts? Curious to see my hacks in action? Want to get a sneak peek at my hacks before they’re available to the public? Then you’d better start following me on Google+ hadn’t you? Just head over to [profiles.google.com/huntergdavis](http://profiles.google.com/huntergdavis) and add me to a circle today! Need an invite to Google+? Just ask!
