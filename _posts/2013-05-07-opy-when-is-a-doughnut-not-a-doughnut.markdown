Seriously though, my significant other and I enjoy the occasional trip to Baskin Robbins and/or Dunkin Donuts. Last night was one such an occasion. While the ice cream was quite reasonably priced at 6$ for two, the stock is currently hovering at around 7 times that. That’s quite a tax for ice cream (and donuts). Still, the stock has a steady 25% gain over 5 years and I do love me some ice cream.

1. DNKN – $41.05

If you’re in the mood for an interesting corporate history, check out the corporate ownership history for [Baskin Robbins on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baskin-Robbins#History). Apparently investment groups love them some donuts and ice cream as well.

Also, it turns out that doughnut jewelry is a popular category of food-related jewelry.
