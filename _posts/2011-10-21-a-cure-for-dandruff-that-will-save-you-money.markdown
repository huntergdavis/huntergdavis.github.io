Ok, so I know that body hacking and personal hygiene are not my usual topics of choice, but hear me out. My entire life I’ve had dandruff, up till a few months ago. That’s almost 30 years of dandruff shampoo, medicated shampoo, frequent showers, you name it. Up till a few months ago.

You see, that’s when I got into [no-poo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_poo) (wiki link). It’s not a constipation product, it’s a movement of folks who have stopped using commercial shampoo. So for the past few months, I have washed my hair daily with warm water only. No shampoo, no dandruff shampoo, no conditioner, no medicated shampoo. By all accounts there has been no noticeable change in the appearance or texture of my hair.

Well that’s not fully true. I lost the dandruff. Completely. First time in my life I’ve felt really comfortable wearing black shirts. I don’t want to come straight out and say shampoo is a corporate scam designed to keep people purchasing an unnecessary product for the duration of their lives, but if the shoe fits….
