While I’ve owned many, many pairs of headphones over the years, these are my favorite. While perusing the local Goodwill outlet (the ones where you rummage through dumpster bins), I stumbled upon an old pair of Nixon studio headphones that had literally melted. I took it upon myself to patch them up.

I then used my dremel to re-bore the air-holes.

Three weeks and 2$ later, a pair of 90mm+ pads show up and I decide that it’s time to get creative.

I cut the centers out of the original pads, then cut them down the center. If you’re doing this at home: avoid the temptation to cut a mobius strip. You might need that material.

Total cost was about 4$.
