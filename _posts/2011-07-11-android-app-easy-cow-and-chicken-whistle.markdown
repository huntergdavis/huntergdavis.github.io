So, I thought I was done with the whistles for a while, but a friend of mine asked for one more. And who am I to say no to one more app ðŸ™‚

Easy Cow and Chicken Whistle is a fast and free app to generate sounds your cows and chickens can hear. Use this to train your farm animalsâ€¦. maybe. You can also use it as a frequency generator.
