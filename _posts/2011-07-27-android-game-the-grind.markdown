The Grind is a fast and free light RPG for the Android platform. The grind removes everything from the typical RPG play system, except the grinding and the leveling! Everything else is automatic. Love RPGs but hate the hundreds of hours they take? The Grind is perfect for you, as you can pick up and play for as long as you like, you character is automatically saved and you can continue whenever you like. Using a hybrid approach of real data and RPG stereotypes, I’ve incorporated thousands upon thousands of real life places, animals, elements, metal types, and more into the game system, so you never have to see the same old “blue slimes” over and over.

Update! – 9/23/2013 The Grind: Expansion Pack 4 is now [Live on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hunterdavis.thegrind). It will be rolling out to Play enabled countries over the next few hours.

New features include Google Play integration with global/friend Leaderboards and 25 Achievements to collect!

This will be automatically updated through the Android Market. It implements some of the most often requested player features since Expansion Pack 1 (auto-saving, a player context menu, more elements, more items, more screen space for the game). All user interface elements are now in context menus or within the interface. This means 10-20% more screen real estate on ALL DEVICES!! This update rolls up all game fixes and balances to date.
