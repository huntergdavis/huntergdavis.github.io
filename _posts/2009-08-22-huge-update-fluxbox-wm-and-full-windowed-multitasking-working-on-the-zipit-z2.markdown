So I got fluxbox compiled. This is a real game changer, as it’s fully configurable via a keys file. You can get my current .fluxbox/keys file [here](http://www.hunterdavis.com/keys). I’ve sent some of the window manager commands like maximize and fullscreen to alt-m alt-c etc. I’ve posted a video of playing scummvm and running other apps simultaneously, below. Exciting times!
