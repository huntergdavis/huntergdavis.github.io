After all the hullabaloo over my open sourcing of my Android work Wednesday night, I neglected to post up about how my [impress.JS resume project](http://www.hunterdavis.com/resume/) has been coming along. I’ve finished the initial layout, and all the initial information pages and frames. There’s a lot of good embedded multimedia in there now (videos, the tuner, QG graphs, images, charts, etc) and I’m finally starting to refine the style a bit and add some CSS. I also added a slide discussing the open source Android update from Weds.

Here, have a screenshot.

* Oh and a quick update, apparently my site got over 3 million hits yesterday, can anyone else confirm this? I’m just estimating from rolling Apache logs. It’s a shame I removed all advertising from the site, eh? hehe.
