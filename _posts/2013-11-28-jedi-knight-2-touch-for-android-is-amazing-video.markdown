There’s a [developer](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=com.beloko) who has been busy porting quake engine games over to Android. This in itself is pretty awesome, but he’s just kicked it up into high gear with the release of [Jedi Knight 2 Touch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beloko.jk2) on the play store. *Note, you’ll still need the original JK2 files from Steam or your original install CDs, this is just the [Jedi Knight 2 engine for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beloko.jk2).

That said, it’s frikkin perfect. It runs full speed on my phone, controls flawlessly with my MOGA pro, all the dialog and cut scenes are intact. It’s amazing. If you, like I, spent countless hours engaged in lightsaber battles and high-stakes deathmatches when JK2 was originally released, you must try this. It’s life changing.
