This is a program I wrote about 4-5 years ago which received some popularity on various international websites and magazines. While not as popular as ssrss, it still made lockergnome and shell city if I remember correctly. You use it to scroll or appear lines of text from a book or text file (or alarm text items you set up, features!) on the current window titlebar of whatever application you are using at the time. Source code available gplv3.
