Team Planning Simulator Reports (TPS Reports) is a quick report generator to help you plan hiring, throughput, and costs for the year, broken down by quarter and 2-week sprint. 

Current features: 
So few, so laughably few.  But hey, enough to honestly help in some situations. 

1. Save and load to JSON for fast iteration!
2. Add roles and event types, then apply them to your calendar
3. See throughput metrics, efficiency, costing, etc. 

It falls squarely into the bucket of "can't you just use a spreadsheet?"  Yes. Of course you can, I've done so for about 30 years now and I'm sure folks will do so for another 300.  However, this is a helpful way for me to visualize, quickly iterate with small features, and quickly generate scenarios without relying on a cloud-hosted python backend for a simulator or stacks and stacks of resource-crazy google sheets.
