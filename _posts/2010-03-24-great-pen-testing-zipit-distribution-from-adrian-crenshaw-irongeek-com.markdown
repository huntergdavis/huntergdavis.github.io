Iâ€™ve been meaning to split this off into a new post for a while now. Adrian Crenshaw (irongeek.com) built a great z2 linux distro, specifically with the intent of pen-testing. You can grab it [here](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/zipit-z2-hacking-userland-side-track).![irongeek distro](http://www.irongeek.com/images/side-track.png) Itâ€™s not only a very cool distribution, (based on a modified rootnexus zipit distro), itâ€™s a very cool reminder of the great things we accomplish building off each otherâ€™s work and sharing information. My only suggestion for his next release is to [counter ](http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=54)his assumption that metasploit wonâ€™t be running at a useful speed on the z2. ðŸ™‚
