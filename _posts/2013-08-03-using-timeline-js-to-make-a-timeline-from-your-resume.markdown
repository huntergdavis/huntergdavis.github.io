As soon as I saw [Timeline.JS](http://timeline.verite.co/) I knew what had to be done. I had to take my existing [Impress.JS](http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/) [resume](http://www.hunterdavis.com/resume/), and make a Timeline.JS version. It’s actually quite simple. You just copy [this](https://drive.google.com/previewtemplate?id=0AppSVxABhnltdEhzQjQ4MlpOaldjTmZLclQxQWFTOUE&mode=public) Google spreadsheet template, and fill in your data. The JS generates the timeline from that. You can see the spreadsheet I used to generate the timeline [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ai234_6pl-gTdE5iSUNQX0taYWFIQ191WUI2cWF5bkE&output=html).

Once I had finished up the spreadsheet, I snagged the newest release of the [Timeline.JS WordPress plugin](http://timeline.verite.co/) updated my WP installation, and added the timeline embed code. Simple as pie. Certainly there are some small bugs, and the titling isn’t ideal, but it’s nothing that can’t be worked around with some clever wording.

You’ll notice that it’s a bit more sparse than the Impress.JS resume. I leave out a great deal of small details (such as those windows apps I wrote that got so popular, or a lot of things about my blog). A timeline lends itself to a “grand overview”. I think this is fine for a developer’s resume, which for a modern developer is just a conversation starter. A portfolio of work is much more valuable to me if I’m in the hiring chair, but I have to admit a timeline is a pretty great overview tool.
