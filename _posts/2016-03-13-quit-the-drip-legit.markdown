Quit The Drip Legit is a combination of two of my favorite things:

1. Quitting drinking coffee.  
 2. Jupyter notebooks (ipython notebooks).

You see, about once a year for the past decade, I’ll decide I should quit drinking coffee. I then carefully map out what days I can drink coffee such that I won’t go through withdrawals. A few months will go by, and I’ll start drinking coffee again. A year will pass, and I’ll start the whole process over again.

Now I’ve automated the process into a jupyter notebook. Simply edit the start date, number of cups you drink per week, and (optionally) the cost of coffee and you’ll be set. Re-run the notebook once in a while(or set it to your start page!) and It’ll even print you out a nice little ascii coffee planner for the current week.

You can download or clone Quit The Drip Legit at my GitHub [jupyter notebooks repository](https://github.com/huntergdavis/jupyterNotebooks).

[M, T, W, T, F, S, S]<br></br>
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]<br></br>
=====================<br></br>
This is a coffee Day, you should have 1 coffee(s)<br></br>
You have saved 4.53$ thus far, congratulations!<br></br>```
