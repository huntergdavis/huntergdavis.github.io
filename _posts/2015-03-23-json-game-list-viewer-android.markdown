“Why is there a resume.JSON format and not a gamelist.JSON format?” I thought to myself this morning. This afternoon I wrote out a first draft of the gamelist.JSON format, and this evening I wrote an android application for viewing gamelist.JSON files. You’ll never again have to use closed or proprietary formats when cataloging your games.

This is a game list viewer application. It allows you to view gamelist.JSON files created in any JSON gamelist generator. It also downloads icons from websites, alphabetizes game lists, and is fast and completely ad free.
