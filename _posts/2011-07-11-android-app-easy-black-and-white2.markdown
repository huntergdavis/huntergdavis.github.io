Easy Black And White is a fast and free app to convert any image into a two color black and white image. It features a convenient sliding scale threshold for conversion, and the ability to select your two colors (they donâ€™t have to be black and white!). This is handy for creating artistic renderings, two-color icons, game art, and more!
