title: 'Only Pay Yourself: May 1st Recap'

Though it was a couple days before the official kick-off, I went ahead and started the investing week early. For the first time, starting Monday I followed the ‘[Only Pay Yourself](http://www.hunterdavis.com/personal-finance/)‘ investment and lifestyle strategy I created [earlier this week](http://www.hunterdavis.com/2013/04/28/lifestyle-are-your-personal-tastes-a-sound-investment-strategy-wherein-i-create-the-only-pay-yourself-strategy/). Any time I needed/wanted to make a purchase, I first had to acquire (at minimum) 1 stock from the company that makes/distributes/produces said product or service.

In general, I’ll be posting up here to the blog and updating my purchase spreadsheet ([visible at this page](http://www.hunterdavis.com/personal-finance/only-pay-yourself-purchase-log/) and at the bottom of finance posts) on any day which I purchase stock or weigh a purchasing decision.

For those that don’t care to read the details, here is how the first two days worth of stock purchases went down:

Read on, for the full write-up:

Activity 4/29/13:

**Breakfast: **  
 I started off the day with my usual breakfast – a blended coffee drink I make at home. It consists of soy milk, chocolate coffee powder, and ice blended till smooth.

This meal breaks down into:

1. The powder, which is manufactured by ‘Innovative Beverage Concepts’, a company with no public stock. I buy it at ‘Cash and Carry’, which is owned by ‘Smart & Final’, which is owned by Apollo Global Management, NYSE: APO . Current price, 26$
2. The soy milk (Silk), which is owned by Dean Foods, Inc. NYSE: DF. Current price, 18.93
3. The ice comes from my refrigerator, which came with the apartment. If I were purchasing the fridge new I’d likely go with another manufacturer, so I’ll hold off on purchasing any stock till that day comes.

**Work:**

Most of the purchasing decisions at my place of business are made by the head of IT and various business stakeholders. I do, however, have great latitude on the type of phone service plan used for my personal work phone. As I recently switched to Sprint, that breakdown is:

1. Sprint, which is traded as NYSE:S, currently at 7.12

**Daily Intake**

During the course of a work week, I generally will grab a sports drink on my way into the office 3-4 times per week. This is almost always a Powerade, which is manufactured by the Coca Cola company. One of my coworkers also hit me up for a coffee, and being in Seattle, Starbucks was the destination of choice. A latte sure sounds like a different (though no less delicious) value proposition when there’s a 60$ prerequisite stock purchase required for it.

1. Coca Cola NYSE:KO, currently at 42.09.
2. Starbucks, NASDAQ: SBUX, 60.00

Additionally,

**Activity April 30th:**

After work is over, I like to kick back and play some games through Steam on my personal laptop. It’s a Dell machine, with an Intel chipset and Nvidia graphics. As each of these brands were choices I directly made when purchasing my laptop, they each went onto the ‘buy’ list.

1. Dell, which is traded as NASDAQ:DELL, currently at 13.35
2. Intel, which is traded as NASDAQ:INTC, currently at 23.4
3. Nvidia, which is traded as NASDAQ: NVDA, currently at 13.66

I am already starting to see a change in my investing behavior. Before this OPY expiriment,

> Until this week, I would NEVER have bought stock in Nvidia, Coca Cola, or Intel.

 These three companies have a reputation for screwing over consumers with bad drivers, bad hardware, and in Coke’s case out-and-out racism. While I can’t speak to the latter, I have been personally burned by the former any number of times.

> These companies are ‘evil’. Why then, do I continue to purchase their products?

In the case of Intel and Nvidia, there is one obvious solution: switch to AMD. And I’ve thought about it, but at the end of the day I use those extra MHZ in my core-i7 and the native CUDA support new Nvidia chipsets provide.

As for Coke, I could easily switch to tap water from Powerade. I just prefer the taste of my ‘power pool water’.

> I could, with a minimum of effort, switch away from these ‘evil’ corporations… but I don’t.

There is obviously more to the picture. And let’s face it, unless you’re a high-roller in the market, investing isn’t about emotional attachment and personal beliefs. It’s about investment. Making money. Owning a part of a corporation that knows how to make money, and knows how to keep consumers coming back.

**Activity May 1st**

As it’s my birthday, I’m not likely to spend any money today. Although I’m likely grab a coffee later, I already own stock in Starbucks so I’m covered on that front.

That does bring up an interesting side-effect that I have noticed during the first days of OPY. By only purchasing items from corporations in which I own a part, I change the economics of choice greatly. A purchasing choice once made becomes easier to purchase again. All future purchases from that company come without a stock purchase attached.

> I am effectively rewarding myself for brand loyalty.

 Is this a good thing? I have no idea, but it’s an interesting experience.
