Yep thatâ€™s right. Iâ€™ve had a few requests to open source Easy Inventory (the first Android app I ever wrote) since I released it back at the beginning of June. As Iâ€™ve been insanely busy at my new job (converting iPad apps to Android apps), Iâ€™ve not had much time for feature improvements or bug fixes. Seeing how Easy Inventory is currently making me about 3 bucks a month in Adsense revenue, I see no financial harm in converting it to an open source project. It also jives rather well with my socialist tendencies. Plus itâ€™s been a while since I threw a project up on SourceForge, and Iâ€™d like to see what folks can come up with.

You can download or checkout the source for the project from [https://sourceforge.net/p/easyinventory](https://sourceforge.net/p/easyinventory)

If youâ€™d like source code write access to the project (please do contribute ðŸ™‚ ), just request it and it shall be granted by a project administrator (currently only me but hopefully more in the future)
