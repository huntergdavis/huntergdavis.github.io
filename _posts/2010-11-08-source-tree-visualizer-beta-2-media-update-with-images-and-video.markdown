For those of you who are not on beta list over at Discursive Labs, this is the sort of thing you are missing out on. If you follow our corporate blog over at [www.discursivelabs.com](http://www.discursivelabs.com), you know that Source Tree Visualizer is an entirely new way to interact and understand the complexities of source control in a meaningful, intuitive way. Rooted in the most current research in computer graphics and visualization, Source Tree Visualizer may literally change the way you think about your source tree forever. Head on over to the Source Tree Visualizer [media page](http://www.discursivelabs.com/?page_id=201) and find out how Discursive Labs is bringing you a whole new kind of source tree visualization.
