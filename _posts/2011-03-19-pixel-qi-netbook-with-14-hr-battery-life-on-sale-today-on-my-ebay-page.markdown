In case any of you have been meaning to pick up a Pixel Qi display and install it into the best possible netbook out there, allow me to save you the trouble. Now that Iâ€™ve got a top-secret e-Ink project in the works, Iâ€™m letting go of my Samsung N210 netbook thatâ€™s got a Pixel Qi screen installed (the one featured in my third book Hacks..). Itâ€™s fully loaded, stacked, and just like youâ€™d get straight from the factoryâ€¦except that thereâ€™s a frikkin Pixel Qi screen installed! Itâ€™s the only one Iâ€™ve ever seen for sale on eBay, ever. Spread the word if you know any cutting edge gadget loving folks that donâ€™t fancy cracking open a screen bezel.

[Hereâ€™s the link to the auction](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=170617839696), itâ€™ll be running till March 24th. Good luck!

If anyone here ends up being the winning bidder, do let me know if youâ€™d like me to sign your case ðŸ™‚
