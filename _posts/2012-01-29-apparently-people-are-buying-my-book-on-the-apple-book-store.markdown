I hadn’t logged into my account in some time (I’m registered with so many publishers and sites etc I end up checking them twice a year or something)  Turns out people have been buying my books on the Apple book store.   That’s cool, and an extra little bump in income I wasn’t expecting.  Not as many sales on Google books though, I wonder if that speaks to the breath of market penetration or perhaps the percentage of book readers per platform.  At any rate, I’ll try and post up a preview of my fourth book sometime soon.
