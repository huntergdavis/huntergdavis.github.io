Just a heads up for folks leveling characters in my pseudo-RPG [The Grind](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hunterdavis.thegrind), Iâ€™ve just pushed live a new expansion pack! This updates the leveling system and adds a ton of new data items. You can (of course), grab the newest code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/huntergdavis/The_Grind), or from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hunterdavis.thegrind)
