Easy Ratings is a fast and free app to visually organize and rate anything. Simply give an item a rating, and it will be saved to the internal database. Organize items by category (wine ratings, video games, etc).

Save a photo or take a picture with your camera to visualize the item. You can also set notes about each rated item. Never forget what wine you like or what ice cream you hate again!
