Iâ€™ve got a few different types of resume floating around. I like to try new things.

You can still snag an outdated PDF resume [here](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2017/other/hunterdavis.pdf).

Check out an ancient (2012?) interactive resume [here](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2017/other/resume/).

[My GitHub page](https://github.com/huntergdavis) may as well be a resume.

[This site as well.](http://www.hunterdavis.com/)

[Here's an android app to view JSON resumes, which I wrote to get potential employers to download my JSON resume](http://www.hunterdavis.com:80/resume-json-viewer-for-android/)
