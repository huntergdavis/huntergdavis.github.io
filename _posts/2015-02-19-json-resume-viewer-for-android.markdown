JSON Resume Viewer is a native Android application for viewing resume.JSON files natively on Android devices.

Yesterday, I had dental surgery. I woke up this morning with an aching jaw and a day off from work. Unable to sleep nor concentrate on video games, I decided to check something off the ole software todo list.

Flash back to a few months prior. I had found myself interested in the resume.JSON format, but there were no android apps to display it in a readable fashion. In order to view a resume.JSON file in a readable format, I had to go to a website (that was down at the time) to attempt to apply a theme to the resume once it had been uploaded to their server? Too much! Open formats need open readers. So today I created one for Android. Open source, Android UI, no ads or strange permissions.
