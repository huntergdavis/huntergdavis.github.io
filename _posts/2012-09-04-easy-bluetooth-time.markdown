Easy Bluetooth Time is a fast and free way to find out what time it is without pulling your phone out of your pocket. Simply select which Bluetooth headset button you wish to use, and whenever that button is clicked a voice will read out the current time in your current language.

You can find it on Google Play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hunterdavis.easybluetoothtime), or get the source code from GitHub [here](https://github.com/huntergdavis/EasyBluetoothTime).
