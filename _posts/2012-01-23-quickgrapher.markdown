QuickGrapher.com was one of the research projects spun out of Discursive Labs.   One of the most promising projects we worked on, it always felt like a project without an intended audience, and it never really lifted off.  I’m quite proud of the work that Mark and I did, and still think it’s a tremendously fun and important project.

You can see an outdated version of it in action [here](http://www.hunterdavis.com/quickgrapher/).
