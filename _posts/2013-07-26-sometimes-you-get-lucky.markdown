Though it’s been many a year since I wrote my first article about thrift stores, they’re still one of my favorite places to shop. Sometimes, it’s like all the stars align to grant you a deal of a lifetime. Today was one of those days.

My good buddy and I had decided to stop in the thrift store on our way back to work from lunch. Lo and behold, it was “Everything is Half-Off Friday”. A quick perusal of the electronics section didn’t yield much, but I felt there were treasures left to find.

Digging in an end-cap I came across a stack of N64 cartridges taped together. 5$ for the lot, but the tape obscured what games were in the lot. Generally thrift shops tend to have mostly sports game cartridges, but for 2.50 (half off day!), I picked it up anyway. Figuring it was just sports games, I sat down on the sidewalk and cracked it up.

Conker’s Bad Fur day. One of my favorite games of all time, and one of the rarest for the N64, this was a treasure indeed. The other 14 games weren’t have bad either. At 16 cents a game, that’s a heck of a good deal!

Moral of the story, don’t be afraid to take a small risk at a thrift shop. It often works out (just ask my friend who found a working HDMI projector for 16$ while I was picking up cartridges!)
