Yep. Due to the continued success of my books after the price increase, Iâ€™ve made them available at more places. You can now preview and purchase [Hacks](http://hunterdavis.com/ebook-hacks-from-hunter-davis), [Distributed Compilers](http://hunterdavis.com/build-your-own-distributed-compilation-cluster-ebook), and [Live For Free](http://hunterdavis.com/live-for-free-ebook) at new store locations! The permalink pages for each have been updated with all the new info! This will also put these titles on eReaders and in stores all over the world in many new markets. These will all trickle out over the next few weeks, so stay tuned! A few highlights:

1. You can now preview, purchase, and rent my books from Google Books in all territories (NO DRM, full copy-paste support).
2. Sony eBook Store
3. Kobo Store
4. Android Market
5. Apple and Apple App Store
