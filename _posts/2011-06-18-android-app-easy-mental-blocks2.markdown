Easy Mental Blocks is a fast and free application for mind-mapping, getting things done, to-do lists, application and route planning and so much more.

If you are not familiar with mind mapping software, do not fear. It is very similar to a Wikipedia page. At its heart, Easy Mental Blocks works on a simple principal: everything has a hierarchy like a pyramid of blocks. When you start the application you are presented with a default heirarchy: One top block and six sub blocks. Each of these blocks may be given a name, or checked on or off, or associated with a color.

*New to version 1.3 is the ability to save pages of text associated with blocks. Simply click the ellipses button next to each block to view or edit the text associated with that block.

If you click on any sub block, you go down a level in the heirarchy and that sub block becomes the new top block in a pyramid. In this way you may generate new levels of the pyramid forever, creating linked levels of to-do lists, mind-maps, and so much more. You may save and load and delete pyramids at any time.
