This is hands down the best game I’ve ever written, for any platform. It WILL keep you coming back for more. It is certainly pushing the limits of what I thought could be done in a day. Using a hybrid approach of real data and RPG stereotypes, I’ve incorporated thousands upon thousands of real life places, animals, elements, metal types, and more into the game system. Think of it like Progress Quest, but with a bit more hands on approach.

The Grind is a fast and free light RPG for the Android platform. The grind removes everything from the typical RPG play system, except the grinding and the leveling! Everything else is automatic.
