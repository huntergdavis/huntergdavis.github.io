As the title implies in our latest article over at Discursive Labs we walk you through the creation of a fully distributed compilation system (i.e. a fully federated system not based on DistCC, Sun’s DMAKE, or other existing distributed compilation tools). The scripts are available in the article and can be dropped into an existing compilation node or as a base for future development. While I have posted a few articles over at Discursive Labs since I last posted here, I thought this one in particular may be of interest to anyone wishing to make their own cluster for compilation or scientific computing. If you’re interested in cross-compiling, low power ARM clusters, virtual clusters or distributed computing and you’re not reading our [continuing series](http://www.discursivelabs.com) then you [should](http://www.discursivelabs.com/?p=370) [really ](http://www.discursivelabs.com/?p=555) [catch ](http://www.discursivelabs.com/?p=610) [up](http://www.discursivelabs.com/?p=673).

*UPDATE — These articles have been collected into the volume ‘Build Your Own Distributed Compilation Cluster’, read more at it’s information page [here](http://www.hunterdavis.com/books/build-your-own-distributed-compilation-cluster-ebook/).
