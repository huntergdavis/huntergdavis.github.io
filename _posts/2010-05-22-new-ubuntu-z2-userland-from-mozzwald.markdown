A pingback from [Geordy Rostad](http://www.notanon.com/zipit/switching-the-zipit-from-side-track-to-ubuntu/2010/05/20/) alerted me to a new Z2 Ubuntu userland from mozzwald. Looks like a very solid first release, and gcc compilation support is back in (apparently its not been working since my or aliosa27â€™s bitbaked userlands??). Head over to mozzwald.com for the [download and instructions](http://mozzwald.com/node/50) and be sure to leave him some positive feedback. Those familiar with the previous Debian based userlands should feel right at home. Happy hacking! ![ubuntu laptop](http://www.ubuntu.com/files/u3/LaptopUbuntu.jpg)
