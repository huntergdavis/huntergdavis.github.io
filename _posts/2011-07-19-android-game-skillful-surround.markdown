Skillful Surround is a fast and addicting game of skill for the Android. Skillful Surround is a game of touch. Random lines will be drawn on the game board, and your job is to surround them with a line you draw. If you touch a line that’s in play, you lose. You earn points for how close you come to the lines without touching them. With a customizable difficulty level and easy to pick up gameplay, you’ll find yourself coming back to Skillful Surround again and again.
