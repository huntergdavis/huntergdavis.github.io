One of my most popular android apps “Easy Graph Paper” hasn’t had an update in a while. Earlier today I received an email with a cool feature request (background images for graphs) so I thought I’d get that happening today while I’m relaxing on my day off.

So, Easy Graph Paper is now updated to version 2.

You can load images of arbitrary size, then overlay graphs on top of them. I used the excellent [PhotoView](https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView) library for zoom controls.

I also added a color picker, for colored lines.

As usual, you can [download Easy Graph Paper in the Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hunterdavis.easygraphpaper), and [browse the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/huntergdavis/EasyGraphPaper).
