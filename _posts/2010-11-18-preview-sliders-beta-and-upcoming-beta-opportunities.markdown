First thanks to everyone who applied for beta status over at Discursive Labs. Your name is on the list and we’ve got an extra secret upcoming project that will be landing in your inbox soon :). If anyone else is interested in becoming a beta tester, send us an email with “beta” in the subject line and we’ll get you on the list.

Also, on a completely separate note we’ve got another technology preview with an upcoming public beta called Sliders (beta). It’s a graphical, dynamically updating equation solving, graphing, and sharing application written in HTML5 and gRaphael. Preview it over at the Discursive Labs [corporate blog](http://www.discursivelabs.com/?p=327).
