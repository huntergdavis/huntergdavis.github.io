Today is the first day of August. After two straight months of adding an app a day (A double software Jedi challenge), I’m switching my focus. I got some good advice from folks over at [HN](http://news.ycombinator.com) in response to a reply I made to an Android post, and some great improvement suggestions from my existing users. After mulling it all over, and looking at my app sales numbers I’ve come to the conclusion that writing an app a day, while certainly possible, is not tenable. Though arguably my overall app quality has improved dramatically, my day-to-day and month-to-month app ad traffic and sales plateaued just after June, and has been slowly declining since. This is even after the rise in popularity of the games I released. As I subsist on my ad traffic and book sales, this trend is quite concerning. Bottom line: though I’ve got another 200 mock-ups and could write an app a day till the end of time it’s never going to make me as much money as my book sales or contract income. It’s not even in the same ballpark.

As such, I’m stopping the app a day. Sixty-five apps in sixty days is still impressive, and as far as I can tell no-one else out there has even released 40 apps in 40 days, let alone 50 or 60. Ever. Anywhere. On any platform. Even just scripts. As of today I’m going to claim the Jedi (or Sith) challenge master crown until someone else attempts to do 66 (or greater) apps in 66 days. This doesn’t mean I’ll stop writing apps, or releasing cool research tech for the Android platform. Just not every day. As an added bonus, this will free up time for me to update my previous apps and brainstorm really good app ideas.
