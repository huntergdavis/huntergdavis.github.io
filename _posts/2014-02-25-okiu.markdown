I’ve been pretty far ahead of the trends before, even [starting](http://www.hunterdavis.com/2009/11/15/hacking-the-girltech-im-me-usb-wireless-device/) a [few](http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/29/dockstar-freeagent-hacked-into-inexpensive-emulation-masterpiece/) [trends](http://hackaday.com/2009/09/25/with-zipit-who-needs-a-netbook/) when it comes to [hacking](http://www.hunterdavis.com/category/hacking-and-robotics/) and mobile devices. When I saw [this](http://www.spritzinc.com/) it made me smile. Looks familiar? Let me super-impose a couple of photos real quick…

Archive.org can help, here’s [my version](https://web.archive.org/web/20031126035210/http://www.hunterdavis.com/navigation/titlescrollscreenshot.PNG) (minus the red central letter) from 2003.

That was a different world then, and I a different person. Still, as always the source lives on at [GitHub](https://github.com/huntergdavis/titlebarscroller).

It got me thinking though, which of my other projects have found their way into everyday usage many years later?

> Turns out Stephen Wolfram, AMD, Feedly, Ouya, HCC, and many others have decided to continue where I left off.

Ten thoughts:

1. I just saw a demonstration of [the Wolfram language](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2014/02/starting-to-demo-the-wolfram-language/) that contained functionality quite similar to [QuickGrapher](https://github.com/huntergdavis/Quick-Grapher) (originally known as sliders)

2. Low powered ARM servers doing the work that big-iron used to? (like [clustered cross-compiling X86-64](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RHXWG6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004RHXWG6&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwhunterdavi-20) binaries?) Looks like [AMD](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7724/it-begins-amd-announces-its-first-arm-based-server-soc-64bit8core-opteron-a1100) is getting into the mix now.

3. [Is RSS coming back](http://www.businessinsider.com/feedly-2014-2)? I can’t tell. I remember writing one of the first [freely available RSS creation suites](https://github.com/huntergdavis/Super_Simple_RSS) (the first with a GUI perhaps?) [back in 03](https://web.archive.org/web/20031217122729/http://hunterdavis.com/ssrss.html).

4. A [filesystem](http://www.smartmeters.com/the-news/4401-hcc-embedded-introduces-smart-advanced-file-system.html) with entries attached to database records. Microsoft promised us this back in 2001. I became so frustrated I wrote a [user-space app](https://web.archive.org/web/20031218231103/http://hunterdavis.com/filemetadata.html) to mimic this functionality (I was 21, it was 2002, I am sure it was for MP3s and cough videos cough…)

5. Why has [code visualization](http://www.hunterdavis.com/popular-open-source-projects/source-tree-visualizer/) not caught on yet? This is happening…

6. [Using](http://www.cepro.com/article/android-based_security_panel_from_qolsys_now_shipping_with_alarm.com_servic/) commodity alternative-architecture processors running Linux variants for home automation? That’s [good times](http://www.hunterdavis.com/2007/12/19/building-a-completely-automated-websshvnc-controlled-home-automation-server-from-a-clamshell-ibook-with-a-faulty-cd-drive-and-10-worth-of-electronics/).

7. Tiny [arm-based gaming systems](https://www.ouya.tv/) that are hackable and emulation friendly? [Been there](http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/29/dockstar-freeagent-hacked-into-inexpensive-emulation-masterpiece/). (OK, OK, I linked that one before. I just like any article where Engadget calls my work a masterpiece…)

8. There’s been quite a bit of [contention](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/) over GitHub and open-source becoming a requirement to being hired, or becoming a de-facto resume. Anything I throw into that debate is going to seem incredibly biased, [considering I was number one](http://www.hunterdavis.com/content/images/2012/04/HunterDavisAndroidInfographic.png)…

9. I saw a [javascript based guitar tuner](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1ymc9m/guitar_tuner_by_tom_hoddes/) pop up the other day. Brought me back to old times.

10. There’s a lot of upcoming consumer-facing technology I’m legally bound from discussing, but it’s fiendishly cool stuff. Check out my current employer, the top 3 programming languages on my CV, and my love of entertainment and let your mind go wild. I’ve got some crazy stuff planned.

So there you have it. Turns out Stephen Wolfram, AMD, Feedly, Ouya, HCC, and many others have decided to continue where I left off; and have left me wondering what my next project should be…
