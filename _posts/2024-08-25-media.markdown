I'm a big fan of [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md/), paying for premium and using it to store notes and lists. 

I was enjoying myself rather thoroughly this weekend while browsing a thrift store in sunny Montana, a couple states away from rainy Seattle. There was a great deal of most excellent used DVDs, Blu-Rays, VHS tapes and other media formats I still find myself using day to day. 

While I have obsidian sync for my local devices, I pondered how to keep my family apprised of what media we have and what we don't, especially when that number is quickly approaching the thousands from the hundreds?

There's a publish option, but that's an additional 10$ per month and I already have a website and GH pages. I realized what I really needed was a way to render markdown tables as HTML client-side, then I could simply point a static page to those markdown files and I've got a nice little interface on the web. 

So that's exactly what I wrote up today. [Live Link.](https://hunterdavis.com/media/) [Github Link.](https://github.com/huntergdavis/media)
