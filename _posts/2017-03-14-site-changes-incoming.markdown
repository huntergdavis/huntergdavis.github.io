Hi All,

Over the course of the next week, you'll be noticing some site changes.  

First off, I've moved the commenting system to disqus, and migrated all of the existing conversations to this new format. In this way, I'll be able to more easily experiment with different blogging systems. 

Next, I'm in process of migrating to the ghost blogging platform.  I dig the simplicity and it's been ten years since I moved hunterdavis.com over to WordPress.  It's time for a change.  If all of the migrations go well, expect to see that occur within a day or two.

I'll also be moving hosting providers away from BlueHost.  The database performance on shared instances just isn't want I want for the price.  

Finally, I'll be experimenting with different themes and navigation structures for the blog. Rest assured I've got numerous backups, exports, and rollbacks ready in case things go wrong.  Fingers crossed :)
