Easy Cow and Chicken Whistle is a fast and free app to generate sounds your cows and chickens can hear. Use this to train your farm animalsâ€¦. maybe. You can also use it as a frequency generator. (FYI: Cows can hear ultrasonic sounds up to 30,000 hertz, however chickens can only hear in an auditory range up to 2000 hertz).
