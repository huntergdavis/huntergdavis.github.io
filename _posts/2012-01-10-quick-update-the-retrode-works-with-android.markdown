I was just messing around with an old eee PC, seeing what it could do.  First I installed Android 4.0 ICS.  It worked fairly well, though the lack of sound on my particular model meant it wasn’t a keeper.   Still, when I plugged in the Retrode it was immediately recognized and I could play the game boy emulator on the market with the directional pad on my SNES controller.  Fun!
