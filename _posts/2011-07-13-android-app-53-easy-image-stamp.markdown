Easy Image Stamp is a fast and free app which allows you to “stamp” image onto a canvas. It fully supports alpha transparancy and pixel blending in images, so you can stamp rounded corners to your hearts delight. You can load an image in as a background, or just stamp images onto a blank canvas. You can use this to generate lolcat memes, edit photographs, cencor photos, make photo collages, and more. It also features the almighty undo button!
