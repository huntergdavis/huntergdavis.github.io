Life is complicated. Can I say 1000 words with a photo? What if I put words in the photo? Mind blown, I know. At any rate, in the ongoing effort to simplify my life (one blog post at a time) I decided to trim down the old wardrobe to just the best and brightest.

What followed was absolute wardrobe slaughter. Madness. Caution and t-shirts thrown to the wind (the thrift-store bin) like the 8-track players of yore. Over 100 lbs of clothes were marked for donation, an unsightly heap of excess. A little bit awesome, a little bit sad.
