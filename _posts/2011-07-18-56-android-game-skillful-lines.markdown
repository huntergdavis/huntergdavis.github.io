Skillful lines is a completely free, thoughtful, and challenging puzzle game for the Android platform. Like all good puzzle games, Skillful Lines is easy to understand but hard to master. Optimized for both phones and tablets, Skillful Lines is a game of strategic placement. This mark my first entry into the Android games market, and my 56th published Android app overall. As all of my programs are prefaced with “easy” in the moniker, so thus will I preface my games with a “skillful” moniker. While the amount of skill required to play my games is certainly questionable, I think a standard nomenclature helps folks when searching for your other items.
