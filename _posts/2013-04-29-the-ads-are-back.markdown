Long time readers will know that I had ads on the front page of this site for many years, but removed them a few years back in lieu of a ‘donations’ button. As I’ve not once received a donation (and frankly I miss the income); I’ve re-added the ads to the bottom of articles. That way you can get through the entirety of a front-page post (and half of a multi-part article) without being advertised to. Hopefully they are not too intrusive, and I think it strikes a fair balance.
