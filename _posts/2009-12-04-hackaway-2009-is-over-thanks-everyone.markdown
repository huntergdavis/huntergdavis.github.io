Aaand it’s over. Just over 48 hours after it began and what a great ride it’s been. What a response! The winners have already entered, they just don’t know who they are!!

I received entries from all over the US, Spain, Canada, Croatia, Germany, Japan, Argentina, Turkey, Serbia, Jamaica, the UK and maybe more! I’ve been logging every entry into a spreadsheet and I’ll be using my favorite random number generators to pick the winners (d10 dice). Thanks everyone for participating! I’ll be sending out emails to everyone and I’ll post the winners later on. Can’t wait to see what freaky projects you come up with!
