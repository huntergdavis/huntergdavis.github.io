So I finally got around to upgrading my site. New features include:

1. Upgraded to Search Unleashed â€“ now comments are automatically searched and search terms are highlighted on clickthrough
2. Upgraded to a theme (LightWord by Andrei Luca) which splits trackbacks and comments!
3. Wide-width theme, better for widescreen displays and photo posts
4. Recent posts/comments widgests, view recent activity at a glance
5. Dropped to a 2-column layout, and removed adsense from front page bar

About time right?
