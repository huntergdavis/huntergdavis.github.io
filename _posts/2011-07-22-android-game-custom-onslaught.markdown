Custom Onslaught is a free and fast paced action game for the Android. The enemies keep coming, so you’d better be ready. With customizable player and enemy icons, a player and weapon leveling system, heath meters and an automatically ramping difficulty level you’ll keep coming back to fight the onslaught again and again! Your health is ever depleting, but you can get it back by leveling up and defeating enemies! Can you find the fabled BOOMSTICK? Can you beat your last high score? Can you survive the teleporting enemies, the big enemies, the small enemies, the teeny tiny enemies? Only time, and Custom Onslaught will tell.
