Source Tree Visualizer is an open source project that visualizes source control repositories as real growing trees. Â It started as a research project at my former startup Discursive Labs, but we felt it was too cool to let sit around somewhere on a hard drive.

Part of this project was to visualize the most popular source repositories on github and google code, etc at the time. Â Some of these turned out with really interesting features and tall branches, etc.

Check out my Google+ gallery of some of the more popular source repositories:

You can get the latest code, examples, media, etc from the github repository here. Â Itâ€™s all BSD licensed, so you can use it most anywhere ðŸ™‚
