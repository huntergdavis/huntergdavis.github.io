Did you know you can temporarily deactivate your Facebook account without losing your Facebook messenger?

I highly recommend anyone who is concerned about Facebook advertisers influencing our elections to consider temporarily deactivating your Facebook account, just for the election.

You can still message everyone, and they can still message you. I'll be doing so myself this 2020 election year, and wish I had done so in 2016. Encourage your friends/family to do the same.
