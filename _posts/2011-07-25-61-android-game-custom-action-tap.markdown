Custom Action Tap is a fast and free Android game that breathes new life into the “balloon tapping” genre. Enemies float towards the top of the screen, and it’s your goal to tap them gone! With customizable enemy models, elemental and explosive power ups, and an ever increasing difficulty level you’ll find yourself tapping again and again. I guaratee this is the most fun you’ll ever have popping balloons 🙂
