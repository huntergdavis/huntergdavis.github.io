It’s been a tremendous 2010 so far, and it’s time for another Hackaway! Hackaway 2010 is about to begin. This one will be even bigger and better than Hackaway 2009, and there are some really awesome hacks coming your way. Rules and prizes and a ton of images after the jump!

![hackaway 2010](http://www.hunterdavis.com/hackaway2010/hackaway2010.jpg)

 Here are the rules.

1. Send an email to hunter at hunterdavis.com with the subject line “Hackaway 2010”
2. Include in the message the numbers of the hackaway items you would be interested in receiving
3. That’s it. I will randomly select the winners after 7 days or 5,000 entries, whichever is sooner. There are no restrictions on who may enter. Any person from any country could win. Just like last time.
4. If you like, let me know what country and state you are from. Last time we had entries from dozens of countries, and it’s always fun to see where they come in from.
5. After the winners are selected, I email them for their addresses, and send out their prizes. There are no fees or restrictions to entry, and I pay all duties, customs, and shipping

And here are the prizes

1. Didj Hacking Bundle – Didj+Claude’s custom board with SD adapter, custom loader, source code, etc. Everything you need to start porting software.
