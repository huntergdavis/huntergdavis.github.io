 Easy Execute â€“ An extremely easy to use C++ library for spawning processes and executing arbitrary commands.  
 This library is intended for developers who wish to simply execute some command, without worrying about the underlying  
 fork/exec/system calls, string parsing, setting up timers, recording the run time of the command, etc. [This library  
 makes it all completely plug and play](http://www.hunterdavis.com/easyexecute.zip "Easy Execute Library"). GPLv3.
