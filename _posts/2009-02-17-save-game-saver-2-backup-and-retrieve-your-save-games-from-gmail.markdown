![Save Game Saver Screensot](http://66.147.244.180/~hunterda/content/images/2009/02/sgsscreenshot1.png) A couple of months ago, [Mark](mailto:christensen.mark.a@gmail.com) and [I](mailto:hunter@hunterdavis.com) were playing some wormux on the PC. I had all my characters and teams set up, and all my macros just the way I liked them. The next day my computer crashed and lost everything. To prevent this from happening again, we sat down and wrote this python program, “Save Game Saver”. Basically you set up a profile for a game (location of save game), then it allows you to upload those saves to gmail. Each upload is versioned in gmail, so you can store and retrieve multiple saves you uploaded on any day for any game. Considering Steam and Xbox are both moving towards this internally, this would be kind of a stepping stone till game developers get off their asses and figure it out. Mark and I both found it really useful though, so go ahead and download it or alter the source. As usual, it’s GPLv2.0.
