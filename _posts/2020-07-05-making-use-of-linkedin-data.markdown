It's been a few weeks since I extracted myself from instagram.  Not nearly as difficult as it was removing myself from Facebook last year, though I hardly know why. 

I had a moment this weekend.  It really hurt my feelings in a way, but it wasn't a surprise.  I was watching a video on youtube, from a few years back, about why we should all remove ourselves from the Facebook ecosystem.  At the end of the video, the author said "let me know when the people from your facebook reach out after you leave, I'll wait."  That really struck a chord with me.  When I left facebook, I had hundreds of friends.  Extended family members, folks I went to school with, folks from previous jobs, etc.  I also had about 8 folks I texted outside of Facebook regularly. 

Fast forward through this year.  It's been an unprecidented time of change.  People are coming together and desperate for human contact like never before.  Many of us are keeping ourselves shut in our houses for months on end.  There has never, and will never be a better time for someone to reach out.  

And yet, throughout all of that, not one.  Not one person reached out from my former Facebook world.  I still talk to those 8 people, but now even more so.  I replaced hundreds if not thousands of hours of my life browsing facebook with anything else.  What kept me on it all these years?  Was it the joy I got from reading another inane political rant?  No, quite the opposite.  It stopped being useful for sharing family updates many years ago.  Same with photos, which also begets a Facebook induced privacy nightmare.  No, it was fear.  I was afraid to leave Facebook, and in some way afraid to face the world where I know I have 8 real friends.  

It's been great though, and I shouldn't have been afraid.  I feel closer to my friends and family than in many years, and I haven't lost anything.

It struck me though, that there's a much bigger fear-based target in my digital world: LinkedIn.
