So I have a blank wall in my basement. No big deal, but it seems like a great opportunity to do something fun, so I decided to re-create one of the classic mario scenes from world 1-1 of the original Super Mario Bros for NES.

First, I used pencils to draw a grid onto the wall.

I then transcribed this onto a sheet of paperâ€¦ roughly.

I realized I could use the stairs as part of the actual level and not have to paint that part.

From there, I found an image of that part of the level, and divided it up into the same number of squares as my wall and stairs.

I use the natural shape of the stairs so I donâ€™t have to paint those sections, and I think it adds some fun.

From there I taped everything off, and just started painting by number.

Things started slowly.

After a while I wasnâ€™t as neat as I had been, but I do think it turned out pretty great in the end.

I even painted the pipes green ðŸ™‚

Iâ€™ll probably add a character or two now and then, good times ðŸ™‚
