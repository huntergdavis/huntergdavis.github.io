I could tell that I had some small measure of success when my 6 and 9 year old nieces became obsessed with one of my Android games: Pop Them Balloons. I realized after extensive kid gameplay testing that I needed to update a few things:

1. Easy mode should be easier.
2. Hard mode should be harder.
3. The balloons should be larger on average, but especially large on easy mode.

And so, version 1.1 is released on the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hunterdavis.popthemballoons). Enjoy. It will be rolling out to devices throughout today and tomorrow, depending on your territory.
