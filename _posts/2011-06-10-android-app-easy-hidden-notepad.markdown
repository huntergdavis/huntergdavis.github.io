Easy Hidden Notepad is a free app designed from the ground up to hide text in plain sight.

Clicking the image lets you select another image to view, but that is not the real intent of this program! Simply hold down on the image for long enough to expose your secret notepad. The application icon name has been changed to “Easy To Use Image Hiding Notepad” to obscure the name of the package in your android icons list. When a would be information thief comes upon your application launcher, all they will see is an icon for “Easy To Use Image..”. Even the icon itself has been designed to trick an onlooker into believing it’s an image viewer application.
