title: Easy Inventory Ad Revenue Increases Upon Open Sourcing?

Hi All,

I thought I’d share an anecdote. After open sourcing Easy Inventory a couple of weeks ago, I figured ad views would slowly die out as more folks downloaded the code, forked the project, made improvements etc etc. On the contrary, AdMob impressions for Easy Inventory have more than doubled in the past two weeks. I’ve always been one to share code as much as possible, but I never would have thought that releasing the code to a project would increase the viewership for the ad-supported version. Will this trend continue long term? Should I open source all my projects? Should I move from SourceForge to Github? Would folks be interested in the source to any of the games I released?

These are interested questions I’ll be wrestling with.
