I’ve updated some of my Android Apps with the most requested user features.

[Easy Inventory](http://hunterdavis.com/android-app-easy-inventory) has been updated with a “bulk sale” option.  
[Easy File Split and Join](http://hunterdavis.com/android-app-ea…split-and-join) has been updated with an advanced multi-join feature, which allows you to join any arbitrary number and type of files together.  
[Easy Pest Control](http://hunterdavis.com/android-app-easy-pest-control) can now set an arbitrary length of playtime.  
[Easy File Encrypt](http://hunterdavis.com/android-app-easy-file-encrypt) can now batch encrypt or decrypt any number of files.
