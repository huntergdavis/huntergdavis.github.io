So the remixing of Creative Commons content into my games continues. I’ve derived the basic formula for the game’s components into base functions, and sub-classed these into sets of mini-games. I do love those mini-games. At any rate, you can see below there’s quite a few twists that have come out of my remixing efforts thus far, with many more to come.

As always, you can grab the newest code (or compiled APKs) at the GitHub page [here](https://github.com/huntergdavis/cantstoptherock).
