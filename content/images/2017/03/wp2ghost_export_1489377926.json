The main weakness of these models was the screen, a paltry 800\u00d7600 resolution. The main sweetness of the project:\n\n> 1. Control your house lights from your phone, any web browser, any ssh client, etc\n> 2. Automate your lights, run complex temperature analysis and face detection.\n> 3. Run ubuntu linux, fully support all hardware functions on ppc architecture, failsafe in case of power failure .\n> 4. Dns forwarding from easy to remember address.\n> 5. Future development: laser calibration.\n\nOk, first thing\u2019s first, what will we need?  \n 1. ibook clamshell  \n 2. 1x usb->serial adapter (~1$)  \n 3. 1x x-10 heyu compatible adapter (~10$ ebay)  \n 4. whatever x10 controllers you\u2019d like (lights, power outlets) cheap on ebay  \n 5. any old usb camera should work (firewire maybe? stay tuned!)  \n The ibook has the following specs, but any computer ~ these specs would be fine:  \n 366mz g3 ppc proc.  \n 368mb ram  \n 10gb hdd  \n 800\u00d7600 lcd  \n 1x usb 1.1 port  \n 1x firewire port  \n Ok first of all, let\u2019s get linux installed on here. Because the cd-rom drives tend to die in these units, this was the case here. The solution was to burn an ~12mb iso image to a cd \u2013 The ubuntu mini ppc.iso image, and keep retrying this boot disk till the laptop booted the cd (about 20 tries). You could also use any other macbook in firewire host mode (check the mac forums for that). The feisty image (works great!, install xubuntu) supports the airport card and the Ethernet port naively, so that was nice. Remember to hold the \u2018c\u2019 key on your mac to boot from the cdrom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile you have that running, let\u2019s do some multitasking. First head over to dyndns and get yourself a dns forwarding address (if you don\u2019t want to have to remember your constantly changing ip address). While you\u2019re at the site, check out their guide to inadyn, some cool open source software to update dyndns with your dynamic ip. Also, if you have a router, make sure to forward the ports for whatever services you want (20-25 ssh, telnet, ping etc, 80 or 8080 etc for web, 5090-5092 vnc, etc)\n\n\u00a0\n\nOk so at this point we\u2019ve got an ibook running xubuntu feisty, let\u2019s install some packages. We\u2019ll want to:  \n Rock open a terminal and break out your su hat. sudo aptitude install the following packages and the firewall software of your choice.  \n openssh-server \/\/this is if you want ssh access to your machine  \n inadyn \/\/this will automatically update your dydns  \n tightvnc-server \/\/if you\u2019re into vnc  \n gnome-power-preferences, gnome-power-settings \/\/easy power profiles (i.e. close the lid, blank the screen)\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow it\u2019s time to plug in you usb->serial adapter. I broke down and paid 5$ on ebay for one, but I\u2019ve seen them locally for about 1$. In a terminal, cat \/var\/log\/messages, and look for lines like \u2018usb 1-1, pl2303 (or your chipset) converter now attached to ttyUSB0\u2019. This is your new serial port, and what you\u2019ll specify to hey-u (software to control your serial port controlled x-10 power line controller). Now go download hey-u. In terminal, run the whole configure\/make\/sudo make install shebang. The install is pretty user friendly, and they ask you for your serial port (which we got earlier from \/var\/log\/messages). Time to try \u2018heyu info\u2019 Fingers crossed\u2026  \n It works!\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt should be immediately apparent if your device is found, you\u2019ll get firmware info as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAt this point things are coming together. We\u2019ve got remote access from any ssh capable device to a command line interface to all the x10 power devices in our house.

Sweet.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Ok, so i&#8217;ve got this old clamshell ibook.  The main weakness of these models was the screen, a paltry 800&#215;600 resolution.   \t\t\t\tThe main sweetness of the project:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<li> \t\t\t\tControl your house lights from your phone, any web browser, any ssh client, etc<\/li>\n<li> \t\t\t\tAutomate your lights, run complex temperature analysis and face detection.<\/li>\n<li> \t\t\t\tRun ubuntu linux, fully support all hardware functions on ppc architecture, failsafe in case of power failure .<\/li>\n<li> \t\t\t\tDns forwarding from easy to remember address.<\/li>\n<li> \t\t\t\tFuture development: laser calibration.<\/li>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"left\">Ok, first thing&#8217;s first, what will we need?<br \/>\n1. ibook clamshell<br \/>\n2. 1x usb-&gt;serial adapter (~1$)<br \/>\n3. 1x x-10 heyu compatible adapter (~10$ ebay)<br \/>\n4. whatever x10 controllers you&#8217;d like (lights, power outlets) cheap on ebay<br \/>\n5. any old usb camera should work (firewire maybe? stay tuned!)<br \/>\nThe ibook has the following specs, but any computer ~ these specs would be fine:<br \/>\n366mz g3 ppc proc.<br \/>\n368mb ram<br \/>\n10gb hdd<br \/>\n800&#215;600 lcd<br \/>\n1x usb 1.1 port<br \/>\n1x firewire port<br \/>\nOk first of all, let&#8217;s get linux installed on here. Because the cd-rom drives tend to die in these units, this was the case here. The solution was to burn an ~12mb iso image to a cd &#8211; The ubuntu mini ppc.iso image, and keep retrying this boot disk till the laptop booted the cd (about 20 tries). You could also use any other macbook in firewire host mode (check the mac forums for that). The feisty image (works great!, install xubuntu) supports the airport card and the Ethernet port naively, so that was nice. Remember to hold the &#8216;c&#8217; key on your mac to boot from the cdrom.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">While you have that running, let&#8217;s do some multitasking. First head over to dyndns and get yourself a dns forwarding address (if you don&#8217;t want to have to remember your constantly changing ip address). While you&#8217;re at the site, check out their guide to inadyn, some cool open source software to update dyndns with your dynamic ip. Also, if you have a router, make sure to forward the ports for whatever services you want (20-25 ssh, telnet, ping etc, 80 or 8080 etc for web, 5090-5092 vnc, etc)<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Ok so at this point we&#8217;ve got an ibook running xubuntu feisty, let&#8217;s install some packages.  We&#8217;ll want to:<br \/>\nRock open a terminal and break out your su hat. sudo aptitude install the following packages and the firewall software of your choice.<br \/>\nopenssh-server \/\/this is if you want ssh access to your machine<br \/>\ninadyn\t\t\t\/\/this will automatically update your dydns<br \/>\ntightvnc-server \/\/if you&#8217;re into vnc<br \/>\ngnome-power-preferences, gnome-power-settings \/\/easy power profiles (i.e. close the lid, blank the screen)<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Now it&#8217;s time to plug in you usb-&gt;serial adapter. I broke down and paid 5$ on ebay for one, but I&#8217;ve seen them locally for about 1$. In a terminal, cat \/var\/log\/messages, and look for lines like &#8216;usb 1-1, pl2303 (or your chipset) converter now attached to ttyUSB0&#8217;. This is your new serial port, and what you&#8217;ll specify to hey-u (software to control your serial port controlled x-10 power line controller). Now go download hey-u. In terminal, run the whole configure\/make\/sudo make install shebang. The install is pretty user friendly, and they ask you for your serial port (which we got earlier from \/var\/log\/messages). Time to try &#8216;heyu info&#8217; Fingers crossed&#8230;<br \/>\nIt works!<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">It should be immediately apparent if your device is found, you&#8217;ll get firmware info as well.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">At this point things are coming together. We&#8217;ve got remote access from any ssh capable device to a command line interface to all the x10 power devices in our house.

My entire life, I have dealt with sleep paralysis. If you don\u2019t know, sleep paralysis is a condition where you wake, terrified, unable to move. Wikipedia has a good article on it, as usual. I just learned to live with it up until a few years ago. I was living with my future wife, who would see me hyperventilating, and shake me awake. At this point, I was just happy I didn\u2019t have to lay there in fear. Time passed, and I began to feel bad for those who didn\u2019t have wives to wake them up. I also worried it would happen on a business trip or vacation. The answer, as usual, was staring me right in the face.\n\nEveryone should get married! Ha. No, the clue was the sound I always heard when this happened. The sound of my own terrified heartbeat. That was it. When in the throws of sleep paralysis, *your heart rate increases*.\n\nI immediately went out and bought a cheap heart-rate monitor with vibration. I bought mine here in koreatown cheap at an import store. They are also available cheaply online for around 30$. Oregon scientific makes an excellent one thats around 40$.

I had all my characters and teams set up, and all my macros just the way I liked them. The next day my computer crashed and lost everything. To prevent this from happening again, we sat down and wrote this python program, \u201cSave Game Saver\u201d. Basically you set up a profile for a game (location of save game), then it allows you to upload those saves to gmail. Each upload is versioned in gmail, so you can store and retrieve multiple saves you uploaded on any day for any game.

To prevent this from happening again, we sat down and wrote this python program, &#8220;Save Game Saver&#8221;.  Basically you set up a profile for a game (location of save game), then it allows you to upload those saves to gmail.  Each upload is versioned in gmail, so you can store and retrieve multiple saves you uploaded on any day for any game.

I think to myself, \u201cHunter, do you need this or is it taking up space?\u201d. The answer is always \u201ctaking up space\u201d, hence my penchant for soldering (taping, hot gluing, welding) things together. This week, it was a slim ps2. Taking the wallclock (microscope edition) apart, I stripped it of a couple of printed circuits (don\u2019t reeeeaaaly need that last row of keys do we?). A disassembly of a ps2 eyetoy camera revealed a tightly integrated circuit board with a sharp L angle. For those of you who have never played eyetoy, it\u2019s essentially project Natal with a low resolution webcam. Fantastically fun at parties, not particularly lasting for single player.  \n  \n Removing the ps2 slim casing revealed a tightly integrated mobo, not a lot of room to fit things in, but a couple of good screw-points for attaching the new screen. From there things came together reasonably well. The eyetoy camera has 2 extra LED lights and a light sensor module that needed to be front-facing. Using a lighter from a coworker, I heated up a large nail and poked a couple of holes opposite the original videophone bezel. Lucky for me, the eyetoy front and back focal lenses attach seperately and I was able to connect them through the front camera and secure it tightly with some superglue. This also lined the camera circuits up l-bracket style, which made for a handy slip-over for the top casing of the ps2. I attached the rest of the videophone circuits together in a vertical sandwich along the back of the ps2 casing. This worked well for two reasons. First, no capacitors are touching, and second it gave me space to feed the extra cabling through (video and usb). It\u2019s a tight fit, but it helps keep the clutter down.\n\nThe next hurdle to overcome was the top-heavy nature of the ps2. For optimal camera gaming, the screen needs to be mounted at a slight angle. This allows the player to clearly see themselves on screen and moves the focal length out another 6 inches or so. This really makes a difference to gameplay as the ps2 eyetoy focal range seems to be on the long side, which makes sense if you assume most players will be playing in their living room. I still had the external casing for the ps2 eyecam, which comes with a pretty sturdy rotation mechanism. Removing the bottom portion of the eyetoy case, I superglued it onto the rear bezel. This gave me a rotating L-bracket, but the rear rotation angle was too far. Luckily the former contents of the eyetoy case were affixed by two lower screws. A couple of 2\u2033 screws served as fine spacers for the rear rotation. The rear bezel from the former videophone proved to be an adequately flat base, however the ps2 was still prone to tipping.\n\nA trip to my local IT pro (thanks Justin) proved fruitful. Out of his junk box came a couple of 15 year old Sun 7K drives (a whopping 8 gigabytes apiece!) whose read mechanisms had died many years ago. These 5lb drives proved to be a more than adequate base for the ps2 eyetoy monstrosity, which now gets carted out for parties or office visitors.\n\n\n","html":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/2_IMG_03981.jpg\" alt=\"ps2 hackamatic eyetoy game\" align=right width=200 height=300 \/><br \/>\nSo every week or so I go to my junk box and look through the parts I&#8217;m not using.

Figuring this was a great way to free up my quadcore from mundane cross-compiling duty, I set about purchasing one and setting up the Z2 cross compiling environment. It took a bit of doing, but it works. Here\u2019s a step by step guide for setting yours up.\n\nI picked up an old 40gb ps3 with a broken optical drive for 100$. Everything else I had laying around. Here\u2019s how I got the Z2 environment cross compiling.\n\n1. I am using YDL 6.2. You can grab the newest 6.2 release from [here](http:\/\/mirror.anl.gov\/yellowdog\/iso\/)\n2. You\u2019ll need a usb thumb drive formatted fat32 128mb or above to install the ng bootloader you can download [here](http:\/\/wiki.pdaxrom.org\/index.php\/Bootloader_for_PS3)\n3. Youll need a usb thumb drive formatted ext3 4gb or above, or a 1gb thumb drive formatted ext3 with a way to share the iso over the network\n4. On the fat32 thumb drive, create a directory structure \/PS3\/otheros\/\n5. Copy the ng bootloader.bld to \/PS3\/otheros\/otheros.bld\n6. Boot the PS3, go to settings->system settings, format system and split the drive up for your linux install\n7. In the PS3 menu, go to settings->system settings, install other os and insert your fat32 thumb drive, this will install the ng bootloader\n8. In the PS3 menu, go to settings->system settings, default os and select \u2018other os\u2019, then shutdown\n9. Extract the contents of the ISO (but not the YellowDogLinux folder) to the ext3 thumbdrive\n10. At this point you can either copy the iso to the root of the thumb drive, or make it available over a network share\n11. Insert the ext3 thumbdrive into the ps3 and reboot with a usb keyboard attached, selecting the thumb drive as the bootable device\n12. At this point you are in the YDL text installer, select the ISO or the network file share, and continue to graphical installation\n13. During the graphical install, you\u2019ll be given the mac address, I like to use this to setup static IP and tunneling while the system is installing\n14. Continue through graphical installation, making sure to set a root password and install any dev libraries you may want (saves you some downloading later)\n15. Watch a movie. Or two. Maybe the LOTR Trilogy. Seriously this will take a while\n16. While the install is running, if you setup static IP for the PS3 mac you can setup your Z2\u2019s package manager, on the z2. just `vim \/etc\/ipkg\/*` and replace all instances of \u201cYour IP HERE\u201d with the static IP you setup for your PS3.\n17. Once the graphical install finishes and you\u2019ve set up your user, it\u2019s time to start installing software as listed on the beagleboard port page\n18. `yum install python m4 make wget curl ftp cvs subversion tar bzip2 gzip unzip python-psyco ccache perl`\n19. `yum install texinfo texi2html diffstat openjade docbook-style-dsssl docbook-style-xsl docbook-dtds`\n20. `yum install docbook-utils sed bison bc glibc-devel glibc-static gcc binutils pcre pcre-devel git`\n21. `yum install quilt groff linuxdoc-tools patch linuxdoc-tools gcc gcc-c++ help2man perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker python-sqlite2`\n22. now compile the bitbake env. (this will dl the git objects ~150 megs as well) `cd ~\/oe && source .\/oe_zipit2.sh`\n23. `make`\n24. At this point, I log out of E17 and into a shell (ctrl-alt-f1). With only 200megs ram we want to conserve ram\n25. Likewise, I like to decrease the number of bitbake threads in oe\/zipit2\/conf\/local.conf from 8 to 1 and disable make threads\n26. re-source oe_zipit2.sh and bitbake something small to get the skeleton directory made (this will take a long time) `bitbake tree`\n27. If you told apache to install during graphical installer, run it now with `\/etc\/init.d\/httpd start`. Otherwise install first.\n28. Make a symbolic link from \/var\/www\/zipit to your zipit deploy target, this allows the Z2 to see the packages you compiled `ln -s \/var\/www\/zipit \/home\/zipituser\/oe\/zipit2-tmp\/deploy\/glibc\/ipk `\n29. on the ps3 (you will need to do this after every set of packages you compile) `bitbake package-index`\n30. on the z2 (you will need to do this after every set of packages you compile) `ipkg update`\n31. That\u2019s that! Install and test your package on the Z2 with `ipkg install tree && tree`\n32. Repeat for each package you wish to install, It\u2019ll be SLOW, but you can stash the ps3 in a closet somewhere and be content it won\u2019t red ring like certain consoles\u2026 even if it does thrash with 200megs ram.. happy bitbaking!\n\n\n","html":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/09\/YDL-PS3-Logo1.jpg\" alt=\"ps3 ydl logo\" width=150 height=150 align=\"right\" \/> I&#8217;ve been seeing a lot of PS3s come up on craigslist with broken optical drives, usually around 100$.

Copy off the 2 wireless firmware files gspsi.bin and gpspsi_helper.bin to a folder, you will copy these back to the memory card after we write the image\n8.

Insert your microSD card into the computer (adapter, usb stick, etc)\n12. Run phsygui.exe from within the folder you extracted psydiskwrite to (requires .net framework)\n13. right-click on the drive letter for your SD card, select the first menu item, and then select the 1\/2gb image you extracted earlier (.img)\n14. After it writes, safely remove the disk then plug it back in. if windows can see the fat partition copy the firmware files to it\n15. If windows cannot see this fat partition, congratulations! Windows sucks! Dowload the ext2 filesystem driver, run it, then copy the firmware files over to \/lib\/firmware\/notlibertas\/ (yes notlibertas, the fat filesystem is mounted as \/lib\/firmware\/libertas so you can\u2019t use that)\n16.

You may need to run fsck if linux can\u2019t see the files.\n18. Reboot, and you should have wireless device when you type iwconfig. Configure the wireless settings, and you\u2019re ready. I like to `apt-get install ssh` right away, as that\u2019s what I use most of all. Ahhhhhhh! Doesn\u2019t it feel refreshing to install new software to the Z2 without cross-compiling?\n19.

It\u2019s an interesting little device, with an b&w LCD display, usb out, 16mb internal storage, and the ability to download or create your own questions\u2026 on windows only (ouch).. Turns out it\u2019s an interesting device. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to find out so far.\n\n![hasbro TP digital choice](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/10\/041791298fd5_Main4001.jpg)\n\nPlugging it into my spare linux box (trusty old ps3\u2026) I found that the device is recognized, but the partition is not. As it\u2019s only a 16mb partition, it shouldn\u2019t be hard to get a good image. I first copied it straight to a file with `sudo dd if=\/dev\/sdb of=\/home\/hunter\/Desktop\/trivp.img`\n\nI began to browse the interface on the device itself. It begins with a scrolling Trivial Pursuit image, and 2 options, \u2018instant play\u2019 and \u2018choose and play\u2019. \u2018choose and play\u2019 apparently requires registration through the software at www.mytpchoice.com. Might be interesting to see how they package their question format, but first I\u2019ll make an existing device image.\n\nThe questions are divided by category ala trivial pursuit the regular game. Selecting a history question, I get \u201cWhat Beijing locale spent 12 cents per was to remove 600,000 wads of gum in 2002\u201d. Beijing is a pretty unique character sequence, so later on I may search for in the image. Opening the image as a binary in vi with `vi -b trivp.img` showed a sig in the first line, SITRONIXTM. This is the same \u201cfake usb storage\u201d controller used on many lcd photo frames with windows-only drivers. There\u2019s a linux program [here](http:\/\/gkall.hobby.nl\/dpf018.html) to retrieve the images, I\u2019ll use this as the basis for my interaction with the device.\n\nFirst you\u2019ll want to load up the tp device as a block device, so we\u2019ll add a sitronix system group with`addgroup --system sitronix`, then add your user and root to that group. You may want to have udev-extras installed. We\u2019ll need to find the usb vendor and product id for the udev rule, so run lsusb. My output looked like ```\n<br><\/br>\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub<br><\/br>\nBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub<br><\/br>\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub<br><\/br>\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub<br><\/br>\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 3078:c081<br><\/br>\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub<br><\/br>```\n  \n So the vendor id is 3078 and the product id is c081. Add the following line to \/etc\/udev\/rules.d\/10-personal-rules.rules, allowing us to mount it as a direct block device  \n`KERNEL==\"sd*[!0-9]\", SYSFS{idVendor}==\"3078\", SYSFS{idProduct}==\"c081\", SYMLINK+=\"sitronix\", BUS==\"usb\", NAME=\"sit_%k\", MODE:=\"0660\", GROUP:=\"sitronix\" `  \n You may also need to \u201csudo modprobe visor\u201d to ensure the rules directory is being watched. Make sure the block device is created with an  \n`ls -al \/dev\/sit*`  \n Mine looked like:  \n`brw-rw---- 1 root sitronix 8, 16 2009-10-10 13:19 \/dev\/sit_sdb `\n\nNow that I knew I had direct block access, I began to look through the image file in a hex editor. At 008fed83, I found `H.a.s.b.r.o. .T.r.i.v.i.a.l. .P.u.r.s.u.i.t. .T.r.i.v.i.a.l. .P.u.r.s.u.i.t..$.......Trivial Pursuit                       0.01..........SITRONIXTM` then a bit later `TP_GAME`. It also looks like there are a lot of \u2018\u2018 characters, probably some XML-like structure. The above blocks are repeated many, many times, so I assume they are the individual question structure. It appears that `SITRONIXTM` is the begining of question structure, and the `H.a.s.b.r.o.` is the end, then it repeats to another block.\n\nFrom here I copied the first block to a file called question1(from 00000027 to 00007e24). This is a bit easier to work with. I then copy out the second block to a file called question2header (from 00007e24 to 0000BE20). Doing a diff on question1 and question2header revealed the \u201cmeat\u201d of the question, a encrypted or compressed bunch of bytes. From here, I\u2019ll load up the windows application, and start to do some reverse engineering if possible.\n\nAfter loading up the windows application, you plug in the device and it downloads all the questions from the device to your pc. Then it does an \u201cupdating your handheld\u201d, whatever that means. A subsequent dd of the block device shows no changes from the previous image. The questions and corresponding keys (encryption keys? answer keys?) are stored in `Application DataHasbroTrivial Pursuit ChoiceMy Questions` and your custom questions are stored (separately) in a folder under that. This is interesting, and may afford us some codebreaking opportunities later.\n\nFrom error messages, we can deduce category names may be 12 characters total. The combined length of a question and answer together may not be more than 160 characters. This is great, as it tells us that they are using a fixed question size on the device, and there will be some padding (later confirmed). This will simplify things some. First I created a category called aaaaaaaaaaa. I chose 11 because it\u2019s a nice odd numbered prime. A file named aaaaaaaaaaa_(myserialnumber).tpc then appeared in the application data, containing `Wild|My Questions|aaaaaaaaaaaa|en-US|0|1.0`. Next I rebooted into linux to check if the block device had changed. This will tell us if categories are stored in some internal rom or on the fs. The md5 sum remains the same, which means it\u2019s stored not on the block device. Unfortunately, this will preclude any linux client until we snoop the file mapped io commands the windows usb client is sending. On the other hand, we can still get a lot of useful info and perhaps determine the file format and file compression scheme. This would allow windows users to share question libraries between each other and facilitate free online question libraries. Hasbro doesn\u2019t seem to be making any progress on this front so we may need to do it ourselves, as usual.\n\nIn the windows interface I wanted to see what types of questions were allowed in the database. Once you have added custom questions through the software interface, they are selectable as categories\/questions in the menu selection on the device itself. A 41-character word does not freak it out, nor does a repeating of 50 words. All quotes seems to corrupt its algorithm and appears to reset the question file in windows, but did not transfer to the device. I next created a question 1111 answer 2222. This added a line to the aaaaa.tpc category file. Then I deleted that question, and made another question 2222 answer 1111. A diff comparision should tell us if the encryption\/compression algorithm is performed over the question\/answer as a pair or one at at time.\n\nThe diff is telling. There is a definite eof sequence. It also appears that there may be a symbol table stored alphabetically immediately before the eof sequence, as switching 1111-2222 to 2222-1111 produces the same last set of bytes but switching 3333-4444 does not. A quick matrix of the hex section shows patterns begin to appear (bad news for crypto). ```\n<br><\/br>\n1111\/2222 =  36 E2 91 6D 7E CB 9D D3 1A AB D3 CE A4 84 BA 69<br><\/br>\n1111\/3333 =  17 1D D5 76 A2 76 51 51 EB 9B 40 F8 ED B4 F9 C7<br><\/br>\n2222\/1111 =  CF 11 FA A5 2C 87 8B E1 1A AB D3 CE A4 84 BA 69<br><\/br>\n2222\/3333 =  3C 79 EA 96 49 B8 47 6C EB 9B 40 F8 ED B4 F9 C7<br><\/br>\n3333\/4444 =  A0 C9 ED B1 2F 80 59 DB 85 C6 DF 16 DC 5A C9 33<br><\/br>\n4444\/3333 =  7F 5C 6B AE C6 CD 1B 17 EB 9B 40 F8 ED B4 F9 C7<br><\/br>```\n\nAlready you can see that when 3333 is the highest number in a set, the last 16 bytes are always the same. Likewise when 2222 is the highest number in a set, the last 16 bytes are the same. This does not hold true for the 4444 case. This may be a boundary case in the mapping, so I make note of it and continue data collection. Once I\u2019ve created enough pairs of varying sizes and frequencies, I\u2019ll do another post about what I can find out about the compression. If anyone else is interested in this, post up your findings etc and we can get some data, check if the compression is standard across devices, etc.\n\n\n","html":"<p>I acquired the Trivial Pursuit &#8211; Digital Choice Edition game at a local target for 10$.

It appears that <code>SITRONIXTM<\/code> is the begining of question structure, and the <code>H.a.s.b.r.o.<\/code> is the end, then it repeats to another block.  <\/p>\n<p>From here I copied the first block to a file called question1(from 00000027 to 00007e24).  This is a bit easier to work with.  I then copy out the second block to a file called question2header (from 00007e24 to 0000BE20).  Doing a diff on question1 and question2header revealed the &#8220;meat&#8221; of the question, a encrypted or compressed bunch of bytes.  From here, I&#8217;ll load up the windows application, and start to do some reverse engineering if possible.<\/p>\n<p>After loading up the windows application, you plug in the device and it downloads all the questions from the device to your pc.  Then it does an &#8220;updating your handheld&#8221;, whatever that means.  A subsequent dd of the block device shows no changes from the previous image.  The questions and corresponding keys (encryption keys?  answer keys?) are stored in <code>Application DataHasbroTrivial Pursuit ChoiceMy Questions<\/code> and your custom questions are stored (separately) in a folder under that.  This is interesting, and may afford us some codebreaking opportunities later.  <\/p>\n<p>From error messages, we can deduce category names may be 12 characters total.  The combined length of a question and answer together may not be more than 160 characters.  This is great, as it tells us that they are using a fixed question size on the device, and there will be some padding (later confirmed).  This will simplify things some.  First I created a category called aaaaaaaaaaa.  I chose 11 because it&#8217;s a nice odd numbered prime.  A file named aaaaaaaaaaa_(myserialnumber).tpc then appeared in the application data, containing <code>Wild|My Questions|aaaaaaaaaaaa|en-US|0|1.0<\/code>.  Next I rebooted into linux to check if the block device had changed.  This will tell us if categories are stored in some internal rom or on the fs.  The md5 sum remains the same, which means it&#8217;s stored not on the block device.  Unfortunately, this will preclude any linux client until we snoop the file mapped io commands the windows usb client is sending.  On the other hand, we can still get a lot of useful info and perhaps determine the file format and file compression scheme.  This would allow windows users to share question libraries between each other and facilitate free online question libraries.  Hasbro doesn&#8217;t seem to be making any progress on this front so we may need to do it ourselves, as usual.<\/p>\n<p>In the windows interface I wanted to see what types of questions were allowed in the database.  Once you have added custom questions through the software interface, they are selectable as categories\/questions in the menu selection on the device itself.  A 41-character word does not freak it out, nor does a repeating of 50 words.  All quotes seems to corrupt its algorithm and appears to reset the question file in windows, but did not transfer to the device.  I next created a question 1111 answer 2222.  This added a line to the aaaaa.tpc category file.  Then I deleted that question, and made another question 2222 answer 1111.  A diff comparision should tell us if the encryption\/compression algorithm is performed over the question\/answer as a pair or one at at time.<\/p>\n<p>The diff is telling.  There is a definite eof sequence.  It also appears that there may be a symbol table stored alphabetically immediately before the eof sequence, as switching 1111-2222 to 2222-1111 produces the same last set of bytes but switching 3333-4444 does not.  A quick matrix of the hex section shows patterns begin to appear (bad news for crypto). <code><br \/>\n1111\/2222 =  36 E2 91 6D 7E CB 9D D3 1A AB D3 CE A4 84 BA 69<br \/>\n1111\/3333 =  17 1D D5 76 A2 76 51 51 EB 9B 40 F8 ED B4 F9 C7<br \/>\n2222\/1111 =  CF 11 FA A5 2C 87 8B E1 1A AB D3 CE A4 84 BA 69<br \/>\n2222\/3333 =  3C 79 EA 96 49 B8 47 6C EB 9B 40 F8 ED B4 F9 C7<br \/>\n3333\/4444 =  A0 C9 ED B1 2F 80 59 DB 85 C6 DF 16 DC 5A C9 33<br \/>\n4444\/3333 =  7F 5C 6B AE C6 CD 1B 17 EB 9B 40 F8 ED B4 F9 C7<br \/>\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Already you can see that when 3333 is the highest number in a set, the last 16 bytes are always the same.  Likewise when 2222 is the highest number in a set, the last 16 bytes are the same.  This does not hold true for the 4444 case.  This may be a boundary case in the mapping, so I make note of it and continue data collection.  Once I&#8217;ve created enough pairs of varying sizes and frequencies, I&#8217;ll do another post about what I can find out about the compression.  If anyone else is interested in this, post up your findings etc and we can get some data, check if the compression is standard across devices, etc.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sat, 10 Oct 2009 17:58:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 10 Oct 2009 17:58:00 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 10 Oct 2009 17:58:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":311,"title":"OpenMSX on the Z2 - 100% perfect","slug":"openmsx-on-the-z2-100-perfect","markdown":"\nBusy busy as always, but still trying new packages as they catch my eye.

Thankfully, I run linux on damn near everything. As I don\u2019t have an android (which would be a pretty ideal running platform for this\u2026), I\u2019ve used the Z2 as my \u201cdrop in\u201d cloud print server. Doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019ll take the manufacturing companies long to integrate this into new product lines, as it\u2019s pretty simple. Instructions and source code links below!  \n![cloud printing from the zipit z2](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/cloudprint.jpg)\n\nSo here\u2019s the plan. We\u2019re going to configure our Z2 to periodically check an email address for emails with attachments. When it finds an email with an attachment, it prints the attachment and archives the email. As you can see from the photo, I place a little notecard on the Z2 which states \u201cEmail __EMAILREDACTED___ to print to this printer\u201d. If you want to print to this device \u201cfrom the cloud\u201d, just email to it. Pretty simple :), and the arm in the Z2 takes up a fairly low wattage overhead as a cloud monitor\/print server.\n\n1. First, we\u2019ll want to connect the Zipit to an existing printer. As I\u2019ve got a network printer at work (fairly common situation), I\u2019ll use that as the example case. Using one of the linux (I\u2019m going the debian (easy) route) Z2 distros that\u2019s popular, boot your Z2 up and get it connected to the net\/up to a state where it can update via apt get. Then ` apt-get install cups ` for printing., and ` apt-get install gmail-notify ` to install all the relevant pre-reqs for python. That\u2019s one thing that\u2019s great about python on embedded, if you know another popular python program uses all your libraries, just install that first and you\u2019ve got your prerequisites covered\u2026or at least all the ones I can remember \ud83d\ude42 You can set up cups to handle various filetypes for printing, but it should come with postscript by default and that\u2019s enough for me\n3. Next, we\u2019ll configure the Z2 to print to a network printer. This will be your \u201cdrop target\u201d. You can either use one of the gui printing configuration tools (select IP Printer from the drop-down list), or the cups command line or web tools. From the [debian wiki](http:\/\/wiki.debian.org\/SystemPrinting), cups runs a web daemon locally than can be used to configure new printers. After installing cups, you can ` elinks http:\/\/localhost:631\/ ` to get to an administration website. From here it\u2019s pretty trivial to print, as your apt-get should have pre-configured a lot of cups for you i.e. samba, workgroups info, etc (interactively in my case).\n5. As this\u2019ll be an open source solution, there\u2019s no need to re-invent the wheel. [Suresh Kumar wrote](http:\/\/code.activestate.com\/recipes\/498189-imap-mail-server-attachment-handler\/) an imap attachment handler in python that\u2019s fairly compact, we can use that as an excellent base to write our script. It\u2019s [PSF licensed](http:\/\/python.org\/psf\/license\/), so you know it jives with our GPL sensibilities.\n7. Now in this script it stores all attachments into their own hierarchical directory structure. You can remove this if you like, but I kind of like having a print backup, at least for a few weeks. This is the write_file() function. Wherever this is called you can add your own os.system call to print the file. For the lazy, if your printer is named \u201cJACKBAUER\u201d at the end of this function just add `sysCommand = \"lpr \u2013P JACKBAUER \u2013#1\" + filename` . This fills a string buffer named sysCommand with our command to print using the lpr function (cups standard printing function). Follow this line with ` os.system(sysCommand) `\n9. Now that your python script is finished, create a script to execute the attdownload.py with the proper variables (username, server, etc perhaps make it a background process with nohup etc). Make the script executable, and you\u2019re good to go. Either add it to your rc.local so it runs on startup or add it to your bash.rc so it loads on login. Congrats!

That isn\u2019t to say that I haven\u2019t been hacking. Oh no. Bootstrapping a startup requires hacking all over the place. During the past week alone I\u2019ve\n\n1. Gotten to know my franchise tax agent on a first name basis\n2. Authored contracts, which in my opinion should be written in python\n3. Authored a research paper on novel methods for efficient bulk virtual machine storage and retrieval (stay tuned for that one!)\n4. Reminded myself daily why I use git, while writing features integrating svn, cvs, etc\n5. Created what, I am fairly sure, is the world\u2019s largest openWRT\/BCM5354 firmware image\/executable set\n6. Created at least 10 new project virtual machines\n\nWhich actually brings me out of my \/startup header and back into :\/publish . One of the terrific things about founding a startup (ducks!) is the flexibility you get while setting up your workflow. Long a proponent of integrating virtual machines into business processes, I have been enjoying the real freedom a robust virtualized system can provide. I\u2019ll get into the detailed workflow later in the post. For those \u2018first page only\u2019 readers I\u2019ll get to the golden ticket, I recently picked up a REX 6000 credit card PDA for 6$ at the local thrift.\n\n![REX 6000](http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/37\/Rex_6000.jpg)\n\nRead on for (much) more and download links!\n\nIn 10 years this 4mhz z80 compatible PDA has remained unrivaled in terms of portability and size. Though I\u2019ve started (in the few non work-related hours I get each month) prototyping work on an e-ink version of the REX 6000, it still has a long way to go before it\u2019s usable. In the meantime, I\u2019ve been enjoying my REX 6k immensely. There were quite a few user programs written for the device in the years after Intel bought and squashed the project, and the history of the device is as fascinating a look at a hacker subculture as you\u2019ll ever find.\n\nAnyway, if you want to develop for the device, there\u2019s a useful SDK that\u2019s been updated to work with new compilers and versions of linux available [here](http:\/\/www.ipd.bth.se\/ska\/sim_home\/rex_utils.html). As I am using the REX 6000 for prototyping (something I often do at work), I figured I would apply my professional workflow to this my personal project. This means a tight, low overhead virtual machine in .ovf format using all open source software which you can import from a vmRepo and be up to speed in seconds (cloud friendly!).\n\nDOWNLOAD LINKS:  \n If you work or are visiting Discursive Labs, you can download rexVM from the VMrepo [here](vmr:\/\/public\/hunter\/rexVM). For everyone else, you can download it directly from hunterdavis.com [here](http:\/\/hunterdavis.com\/rexVM.zip).  \n 971,810,614 Bytes, will be available 6am Pacific Time August 24th 2010 \u2026\n\nOne forum post which has saved me immense amounts of time in this process has been [this one at ubuntuforums](http:\/\/ubuntuforums.org\/showthread.php?t=575456). I could have (and many many times have) built debian based VM\u2019s from scratch\/stock\/server Ubuntu distros and it is just not the same as when you build from a minimal system that\u2019s got just what you want in it. Here\u2019s how I setup rexVM. I use a set of scripts at DL but for personal projects I don\u2019t mind starting from a fresh interactive command line. Assuming Ubuntu, and wanting to use Puppy (for smallest size\u2026 installing make and svn could be easier \u2026). We\u2019re going to do this a bit backwards. Puppy likes running in live cd mode, especially when you want to have the devx (compiler) package running. We\u2019re going to install puppy in hard drive mode, then copy the contents of the devx package into our compiler.\n\n1. Download puppy linux 5.1, this is a great tight base image to start building from\n2. Fire up VirtualBox, and create a new VM named rexVM. For tightly bound development I like to have a 10gb expanding size disk and a small amount of ram ~256mb -i.e. lots of room for libraries and enough ram to compile\n3. Add the puppy-510.iso to your virtual media manager\n4. On the rexVM details page, add the puppy-510.iso as the ide secondary master (cd-drive)\n5. Boot up the VM, and in puppy select \u2018system->puppy universal installer\u2019\n6. Open gParted, device->create partition table, then partition your virtual HDD to 9.5gb ext3\/.5gb swap\n7. Set the boot flag to on for the partition you just created\n8. Close gParted and the installer will commence-do a full install and install grub to sda1\n9. Shutdown the VM and de-attach the pupper live iso from the system\n10. Once it boots up, open system->quickpet and install the xorg_high driver\n11. Reboot or restart the x-server to activated\n12. Open the puppy package configuration utility and add extra repositories\n13. Close the package utility and download the [devx package from here](http:\/\/distro.ibiblio.org\/pub\/linux\/distributions\/puppylinux\/puppy-5.1\/lupu_devx_510.sfs)\n14. Click on the devx_510.sfs in a ROX-Filer window to mount it.\n15. Open a terminal in the mounted directory. (\/mnt\/+lupu_devx_510.sfs)\n16. `cp -a --remove-destination .\/* \/mnt\/home\/`\n17. Reboot the VM\n18. At this point we should be ready for the compiler, so make yourself a project directory\n19. `mkdir \/projects\/rexVM`\n20. Enter that directory, and checkout the rxSDK\n21. `svn co https:\/\/mondragon.tek.bth.se\/svn\/main\/world\/ska\/rex\/trunk\/rxsdk\/`\n22. (you\u2019ll need to accept his security cert..which may be expired bleh)\n23. cd into the rexSDK directory, and edit the Makefile\n24. Change the sdcc: svn root target to be https:\/\/sdcc.svn.sourceforge.net\/svnroot\/sdcc\/trunk\/sdcc sdcc\n25. (Make sure you\u2019ve got the extra \/sdcc\/trunk\/sdcc on the end of that link!! )\n26. Now copy over the sdcc-sparse link directory with `cp -rp .\/sdcc-sparse\/link\/ .\/sdcc\/ `\n27. Now, in that same directory, make the project with a standard `make`\n28. This may take a while, grab a snack, or cheat a little and up the ram\/cpus on your VM during this compile \ud83d\ude09\n29. Once sdcc has finished compiling, execute a ` make install_sdcc `\n30. Once sdcc has finished installing, softlink the z80 assemler command ` ln -s \/usr\/local\/bin\/sdasz80 \/usr\/local\/bin\/as-z80 `\n31. Execute the next make step with ` make build_rxsdk `\n32. Once rxsdk has finished compiling, execute a ` make install_rxsdk `\n33. If install_rxsdk barfs on librex, manually finish the tool compile install with `cd rxsdk\/tools\/rxbuild && make install`\n34. At this point, you have a nice build environment for your REX 6000 (and really most z80 based chipsets)\n35. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll want to export the virtual appliance as a .ovf and add it to your vmRepo\n\nAnd that\u2019s that. Time for me to setup \u2013 hours. Time for each developer after me to setup a REX 6000 development environment? The time taken to download a ~970mb zip file. About 20 seconds over my local wifi network \u2014 not bad! You can more generically use these instructions to create any number of custom compile environments. Like the 300mb Z2 image I posted so long ago, I\u2019ll post the 1gb rexVM for as long as it doesn\u2019t start to eat up my bandwidth. Considering there\u2019s probably 50 REX users left out there, (only one of whom I\u2019m sure reads this blog) I\u2019m not too worried. Happy Hacking!!\n\n\n","html":"<p>As most of you readers probably know, I have been terribly remiss in my postings of late.  That isn&#8217;t to say that I haven&#8217;t been hacking.  Oh no.  Bootstrapping a startup requires hacking all over the place.  During the past week alone I&#8217;ve <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gotten to know my franchise tax agent on a first name basis<\/li>\n<li>Authored contracts, which in my opinion should be written in python<\/li>\n<li>Authored a research paper on novel methods for efficient bulk virtual machine storage and retrieval (stay tuned for that one!)<\/li>\n<li>Reminded myself daily why I use git, while writing features integrating svn, cvs, etc<\/li>\n<li>Created what, I am fairly sure, is the world&#8217;s largest openWRT\/BCM5354 firmware image\/executable set<\/li>\n<li>Created at least 10 new project virtual machines<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Which actually brings me out of my \/startup header and back into :\/publish .  One of the terrific things about founding a startup (ducks!) is the flexibility you get while setting up your workflow.  Long a proponent of integrating virtual machines into business processes, I have been enjoying the real freedom a robust virtualized system can provide.  I&#8217;ll get into the detailed workflow later in the post.  For those &#8216;first page only&#8217; readers I&#8217;ll get to the golden ticket, I recently picked up a REX 6000 credit card PDA for 6$ at the local thrift.  <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/37\/Rex_6000.jpg\" alt=\"REX 6000\" align=\"left\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Read on for (much) more and download links!<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>In 10 years this 4mhz z80 compatible PDA has remained unrivaled in terms of portability and size.  Though I&#8217;ve started (in the few non work-related hours I get each month) prototyping work on an e-ink version of the REX 6000, it still has a long way to go before it&#8217;s usable.  In the meantime, I&#8217;ve been enjoying my REX 6k immensely.  There were quite a few user programs written for the device in the years after Intel bought and squashed the project, and the history of the device is as fascinating a look at a hacker subculture as you&#8217;ll ever find.  <\/p>\n<p>Anyway, if you want to develop for the device, there&#8217;s a useful SDK that&#8217;s been updated to work with new compilers and versions of linux available <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ipd.bth.se\/ska\/sim_home\/rex_utils.html\">here<\/a>.  As I am using the REX 6000 for prototyping (something I often do at work), I figured I would apply my professional workflow to this my personal project.  This means a tight, low overhead virtual machine in .ovf format using all open source software which you can import from a vmRepo and be up to speed in seconds (cloud friendly!). <\/p>\n<p>DOWNLOAD LINKS:<br \/>\nIf you work or are visiting Discursive Labs, you can download rexVM from the VMrepo <a href=\"vmr:\/\/public\/hunter\/rexVM\">here<\/a>.  For everyone else, you can download it directly from hunterdavis.com <a href=\"http:\/\/hunterdavis.com\/rexVM.zip\">here<\/a>.<br \/>\n971,810,614 Bytes, will be available 6am Pacific Time August 24th 2010 &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>One forum post which has saved me immense amounts of time in this process has been <a href=\"http:\/\/ubuntuforums.org\/showthread.php?t=575456\">this one at ubuntuforums<\/a>.  I could have (and many many times have) built debian based VM&#8217;s from scratch\/stock\/server Ubuntu distros and it is just not the same as when you build from a minimal system that&#8217;s got just what you want in it.  Here&#8217;s how I setup rexVM.  I use a set of scripts at DL but for personal projects I don&#8217;t mind starting from a fresh interactive command line.  Assuming Ubuntu, and wanting to use Puppy (for smallest size&#8230; installing make and svn could be easier &#8230;).  We&#8217;re going to do this a bit backwards.  Puppy likes running in live cd mode, especially when you want to have the devx (compiler) package running.  We&#8217;re going to install puppy in hard drive mode, then copy the contents of the devx package into our compiler.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download puppy linux 5.1, this is a great tight base image to start building from<\/li>\n<li>Fire up VirtualBox, and create a new VM named rexVM.  For tightly bound development I like to have a 10gb expanding size disk and a small amount of ram ~256mb -i.e. lots of room for libraries and enough ram to compile<\/li>\n<li>Add the puppy-510.iso to your virtual media manager<\/li>\n<li>On the rexVM details page, add the puppy-510.iso as the ide secondary master (cd-drive)<\/li>\n<li>Boot up the VM, and in puppy select &#8216;system->puppy universal installer&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Open gParted, device->create partition table, then partition your virtual HDD to 9.5gb ext3\/.5gb swap<\/li>\n<li>Set the boot flag to on for the partition you just created<\/li>\n<li>Close gParted and the installer will commence-do a full install and install grub to sda1<\/li>\n<li>Shutdown the VM and de-attach the pupper live iso from the system<\/li>\n<li>Once it boots up, open system->quickpet and install the xorg_high driver<\/li>\n<li>Reboot or restart the x-server to activated<\/li>\n<li>Open the puppy package configuration utility and add extra repositories<\/li>\n<li>Close the package utility and download the <a href=\"http:\/\/distro.ibiblio.org\/pub\/linux\/distributions\/puppylinux\/puppy-5.1\/lupu_devx_510.sfs\">devx package from here<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Click on the devx_510.sfs in a ROX-Filer window to mount it.<\/li>\n<li>Open a terminal in the mounted directory.

Time for me to setup &#8211; hours.  Time for each developer after me to setup a REX 6000 development environment?  The time taken to download a ~970mb zip file.  About 20 seconds over my local wifi network &#8212; not bad!  You can more generically use these instructions to create any number of custom compile environments.

I show it running\n\n- Scummvm (Monkey Island 3)\n- NES (Contra)\n- Doxbox (Warcraft)\n- Mednafen\u2013\n- Lynx (Lemmings)\n- GBA (Aria of Sorrow)\n- GBC (Lufia)\n- GB (Links Awakening)\n- TurboGrafx (Bonk 3)\n- NeoGeo Pocket (Last Blade)\n- Wonderswan (Guilty Gear Petite 2)\n- stella 2600 (Adventure)\n- VisualBoyAdvance (Mario World)\n- SuperTux\n- Abuse \u2013 Actually this was cut for time in the youtube clip but it plays perfectly.\n- Wesnoth\n- yabuase Sega Saturn (Sonic Extreme)\n- Quake 3 (OpenArena)\n\nMost with the exception of Saturn and OpenArena run at full playable speed with sound and full or near fullscreen graphics. I have no reason to believe SNES or even Mame and Playstation are out of the picture, with some cleverness. There is so much more below.\n\nFor everyone else, read on for photos, configuration files, tips, tricks, explanations, and a thorough walkthrough of the process.\n\n**Wasted MHZ**  \n One of the greatest things about the pogoplug is the ease of finding cheap reference hardware. I have been purchasing Dockstar FreeAgent (pogoplug NAS devices) for 25$ shipped for sometime now, and they make for a great low power cluster node. However, what they are not great at is video. They have no discrete graphics, and only 3 USB and one gigabit ethernet ports to work with. On the other hand, they are rocking 128mb of internal ram, 256megs of rom (for flashing images if desired, I just throw mine on a USB stick), and a 1.2ghz marvell arm processor. For a device which consumes a mere 4-6 watts of power at full load, this is a hell of a powerful processor at this price point.\n\nI mean think about it. That\u2019s 1200 mhz of processing power with 128mb of ram. Among some of the low power machines I have developed for, that\u2019s orders of magnitude beyond what the status quo is. My gameboy advance ran a similar architecture at 17mhz, and I had a hell of a good time playing those games and developing for that system (still an order of magnitude faster than the first systems I wrote code for!). These facts and the fact that debian-arm (which Jeff Doozan has a handy script to [install on a Dockstar](http:\/\/jeff.doozan.com\/debian\/)) has an easy to use apt and deb based install system and a full compiler chain really got me thinking. 6 watts, 1.2ghz, 128mb ram, 25$\u2026. Could the Dockstar be the cheaper alternative to the open Pandora handheld I\u2019d been looking for? (Note \u2013 I love the openPandora, and what it stands for. Go buy one now!)\n\n**Ignoring Battery, for now**\n\nAlthough I intend to eventually turn this into a battery powered handheld system, for the initial tests I\u2019ll be running everything off A\/C or my car\u2019s DC socket. No battery array has been built for this system yet. I imagine my next build may use a mimo or lilliput usb powered monitor (built-in displaylink chip) instead of the usb->dvi adapter I used for this test. In the future, I\u2019ll be doing some power requirements testing and perhaps some battery engineering for this. Even using this as a console replacement instead of a handheld replacement, the argument is quite strong. This device uses 20-30 times less power than a PS3. So if you\u2019re running off the grid and you want to emulate yourself some Mario Brothers, for the same power usage you get 5 minutes of PS3 or 2.5 hours of the Dockstar.\n\n**Paying Again and Again**\n\nI have been chastised heavily for this believe for many years now, but if you are not legally backing up\/dumping the roms for your arcade or cartridge games you are almost certainly costing yourself money. While many consider emulation to be an underground community by its nature, there are quite legal ways for you to enjoy your existing game library without resorting to theft of intellectual property, or worse re-purchasing the games for each platform as they are slowly re-released by the publisher. Support folks like Matthias_H and back up or play your cartridges legally with solutions like the [retrode](http:\/\/www.retrode.org\/), a hand coded nes rom dumper [like this one](http:\/\/www.barkered.com\/old-site-content\/nes\/rom-dumper\/), or at least play some [free homebrew roms.](http:\/\/dl.qj.net\/psp\/homebrew-packs-roms.html)\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_846\" style=\"width: 306px\">[![Dockstar Running NES and ScummVM over TightVNC](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/epicwin1-300x187.jpg \"Dockstar Running NES and ScummVM over TightVNC\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/epicwin1.jpg)Dockstar Running NES and ScummVM over TightVNC\n\n<\/div>**Proof of Concept**\n\nBefore running out to my local computer shop and plunking down the 60$ for a decent USB displaylink adapter, I wanted to make sure the Dockstar was actually capable of emulating a couple of systems. After using Jeff Doozan\u2019s debian install script (which disables the pogoplug service, installs uboot, bootstraps debian onto the USB drive etc) I installed VNC server and Xorg (gotta have those fonts!), and started up two separate VNC sessions. In the first, I emulated contra with a nes emulator from the debian repository, controlled via a usb gamepad I had plugged in via an extra USB port gained from plugging in an old IBM USB keyboard with built-in hub. In the second, I used ScummVM to emulate Monkey Island 2 (both of which I have purchased many, many times). I then streamed both of these over the network to my desktop PC, simultaneously. So, concurrently, there was USB gamepad usage, NES emulation , Scummvm emulation, 2 X servers, 2 framebuffers being compressed with jpeg and tightvnc compression, 2 remote console terminals with byobu screen and a TOP processing showing CPU usage\u2026 which never pegged out, and natually was mostly spent on the TightVNC server processes. This gave me a bit of confidence when heading out to the store to purchase more hardware.\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_860\" style=\"width: 252px\">[![Alsamixer on the Dockstar Debian System](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/alsamixer1-246x300.png \"AlsaMixer on the Dockstar Debian System\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/alsamixer1.png)Alsamixer on the Dockstar Debian System\n\n<\/div>**Easy and Cheap- Audio**\n\nThe first missing component on the Dockstar is audio. I picked up a SIIC usb soundwave 7.1 soundcard for about 15 bucks at Frys. I\u2019ve seen similar usb audio plugs for 1$ from sites like DX and meritline, but I prefer to shop local the first go-round in case anything needs to be returned. After pluggin it in, the dmesg log said ```\n[  146.847548] usb 1-1.4: New USB device found, idVendor=0d8c, idProduct=0103<br><\/br>\n[  146.854467] usb 1-1.4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0<br><\/br>\n[  146.861822] usb 1-1.4: Product: USB Sound Device<br><\/br>\n[  146.867195] usb 1-1.4: Manufacturer: C-Media INC.<br><\/br>\n[  146.873810] usb 1-1.4: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice<br><\/br>\n[  147.085508] usbcore: registered new interface driver snd-usb-audio<br><\/br>```\n\nLooked good to me, so I went ahead and installed alsa and some utilities with ` apt-get install alsa alsa-utils apmd alsa-oss mpg123` This worked without a hitch, and alsamixer showed our PCM line out. A quick test with mpg123 determined sound was working fine, no additional setup required. After a reboot however, this was seemingly no longer working? I tried installing libasound2-plugins, which pulls in a good number of prerequisites,. no no avail. Turns out a ` \/usr\/bin\/alsa reload ` was all that was required to get it working again. So watch out for that.\n\n**Getting Ready \u2013 Video**\n\nThe USB displaylink linux driver and setup has grown in leaps and bounds since last I had looked into it back in 09. I picked up an IOGEAR USB->DVI external graphics adapter for 50$ open box at Frys (serial GUC2020DW6) as it supported 1080p out of the box. I\u2019ve seen these for as low as 30$, though the price fluctuates around 60$ generally. I imagine any usb->vga or direct usb->lcd solution would also work with the same results. That\u2019s what\u2019s great about running a full Debian Linux distribution on this thing, you get a world of device compatibility out of the box. Having wrestled with a similar IOGEAR graphics adapter in the past, I was fairly confident it used the displaylink chipset and driver. Even better, this particular USB->DVI adapter has a standard USB mini female plug on one end. This means we won\u2019t need to waste a port on the Dockstar, as the male USB mini plug is active and fits the adapter. If you can\u2019t manage to squeeze the adapter onto the plug in the current position, it is only a 5 wire cable attached to the plastic casing. Removing the casing should resolve any spacing issues. I just cut a small hole between the 2 existing usb ports and run the micro usb cable through there.\n\n**Video, Continued**\n\nA quick search turned up a nice tutorial on setting up USB multiseat over at [plugable.com](http:\/\/plugable.com\/2009\/11\/16\/setting-up-usb-multiseat-with-displaylink-on-linux-gdm-up-to-2-20\/). While a bit dated, I figured it was roughly analogous to the Dockstar Debian system I had running and should work. After installing module-assistant, I decided to skip the entire tutorial and just try plugging the device into the Dockstar and a (failing) 15\u2033 vga Monitor from ancient times and seeing what happens\u2026 Success! It was a green screen with no borders. This means the driver is loaded and working! A quick test of dmesg showed what I wanted to see\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_870\" style=\"width: 306px\">[![DisplayLink Green Screen From Dockstar](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_673211-300x225.jpg \"DisplayLink Green Screen From Dockstar\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_673211.jpg)DisplayLink Green Screen From Dockstar\n\n<\/div>```\n<br><\/br>\n[ 4033.407189] usb 1-1.1: New USB device found, idVendor=17e9, idProduct=0059<br><\/br>\n[ 4033.414104] usb 1-1.1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3<br><\/br>\n[ 4033.421500] usb 1-1.1: Product: IOGEAR External DVI<br><\/br>\n[ 4033.426443] usb 1-1.1: Manufacturer: DisplayLink<br><\/br>\n[ 4033.431080] usb 1-1.1: SerialNumber: 009866<br><\/br>\n[ 4033.444201] usb 1-1.1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice<br><\/br>\n[ 4033.509436] udlfb: module is from the staging directory, the quality is unknown, you have been warned.<br><\/br>\n[ 4033.532242] usb 1-1.1: dlfb: allocated 4 65024 byte urbs<br><\/br>\n[ 4033.620197] usb 1-1.1: dlfb: set_par mode 1024x768<br><\/br>\n[ 4033.648492] usb 1-1.1: dlfb: DisplayLink USB device \/dev\/fb0 attached. 1024x768 resolution.

It produced another green screen. This is good, as it means we\u2019ll not have to be manually stopping fbcon from starting on bootup as many guides have suggested. While I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s necessary, I went ahead and installed pkg-config and xorg-dev, along with fluxbox and xdm. They pull in a lot of good prerequisites from the Debian apt repository, and may come in handly later.\n\nSpeaking of guides, I found a nice article on setting up your Xorg on a DisplayLink device [here](http:\/\/mulchman.org\/blog\/?p=90).

Now edit your .xsession file to contain `exec startfluxbox` and you should be ready for fluxbox. Success! From here it\u2019s all gravy. ScummVM works. NES emulation works. Web browsing, consoles, fluxbox, full windowing systems, etc etc so much working!!\n\n**Playing Games**\n\n- fceu works great for playing NES roms. Make sure you disable openGL or it will not run correctly.\n- ScummVM works great out of the box, even with quite large files. Check the video for me playing Monkey Island 3 (1gb game) flawlessly\n- Dosbox \u2013 Edit your ~\/.dosbox\/dosbox-0.74.conf and put your install directory as a mount i.e. `mount c ~\/dosbox\/images\/ `\n- Mednafen \u2013 Make sure to pass the `-vdriver sdl` argument to mednafen or it will be slow. Use alt-shift-1 to auto-configure your joysticks\n\nAnything in the debian repo should work (no guarantees on speed). I managed to install desmume the ds emulator, but it didn\u2019t run faster than 3fps ever, and didn\u2019t seem to do much.\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_905\" style=\"width: 306px\">[![OpenArena On the Dockstar](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_674111-300x225.jpg \"OpenArena\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_674111.jpg)OpenArena On the Dockstar\n\n<\/div>**Installing Programs\/Desktop Usage**\n\n- Do yourself a favor and install aptitude and synaptic!

I have been purchasing Dockstar FreeAgent (pogoplug NAS devices) for 25$ shipped for sometime now, and they make for a great low power cluster node.  However, what they are not great at is video.  They have no discrete graphics, and only 3 USB and one gigabit ethernet ports to work with.  On the other hand, they are rocking 128mb of internal ram, 256megs of rom (for flashing images if desired, I just throw mine on a USB stick), and a 1.2ghz marvell arm processor.  For a device which consumes a mere 4-6 watts of power at full load, this is a hell of a powerful processor at this price point.<\/p>\n<p>I mean think about it.  That&#8217;s 1200 mhz of processing power with 128mb of ram.  Among some of the low power machines I have developed for, that&#8217;s orders of magnitude beyond what the status quo is.  My gameboy advance ran a similar architecture at 17mhz, and I had a hell of a good time playing those games and developing for that system (still an order of magnitude faster than the first systems I wrote code for!).  These facts and the fact that debian-arm (which Jeff Doozan has a handy script to <a href=\"http:\/\/jeff.doozan.com\/debian\/\">install on a Dockstar<\/a>) has an easy to use apt and deb based install system and a full compiler chain really got me thinking.  6 watts, 1.2ghz, 128mb ram, 25$&#8230;. Could the Dockstar be the cheaper alternative to the open Pandora handheld I&#8217;d been looking for?  (Note &#8211; I love the openPandora, and what it stands for.  Go buy one now!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ignoring Battery, for now<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although I intend to eventually turn this into a battery powered handheld system, for the initial tests I&#8217;ll be running everything off A\/C or my car&#8217;s DC socket.  No battery array has been built for this system yet.  I imagine my next build may use a mimo or lilliput usb powered monitor (built-in displaylink chip) instead of the usb->dvi adapter I used for this test.  In the future, I&#8217;ll be doing some power requirements testing and perhaps some battery engineering for this.  Even using this as a console replacement instead of a handheld replacement, the argument is quite strong.  This device uses 20-30 times less power than a PS3.  So if you&#8217;re running off the grid and you want to emulate yourself some Mario Brothers, for the same power usage you get 5 minutes of PS3 or 2.5 hours of the Dockstar.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Paying Again and Again<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have been chastised heavily for this believe for many years now, but if you are not legally backing up\/dumping the roms for your arcade or cartridge games you are almost certainly costing yourself money.  While many consider emulation to be an underground community by its nature, there are quite legal ways for you to enjoy your existing game library without resorting to theft of intellectual property, or worse re-purchasing the games for each platform as they are slowly re-released by the publisher.  Support folks like Matthias_H and back up or play your cartridges legally with solutions like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.retrode.org\/\">retrode<\/a>, a hand coded nes rom dumper <a href=\"http:\/\/www.barkered.com\/old-site-content\/nes\/rom-dumper\/\">like this one<\/a>, or at least play some <a href=\"http:\/\/dl.qj.net\/psp\/homebrew-packs-roms.html\">free homebrew roms.<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_846\" style=\"width: 306px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/epicwin1.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/epicwin1-300x187.jpg\" alt=\"Dockstar Running NES and ScummVM over TightVNC\" title=\"Dockstar Running NES and ScummVM over TightVNC\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-846\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/epicwin1-300x187.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/epicwin1-1024x640.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/epicwin1-480x300.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dockstar Running NES and ScummVM over TightVNC<\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>Proof of Concept<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before running out to my local computer shop and plunking down the 60$ for a decent USB displaylink adapter, I wanted to make sure the Dockstar was actually capable of emulating a couple of systems.  After using Jeff Doozan&#8217;s debian install script (which disables the pogoplug service, installs uboot, bootstraps debian onto the USB drive etc) I installed VNC server and Xorg (gotta have those fonts!),  and started up two separate VNC sessions.  In the first, I emulated contra with a nes emulator from the debian repository, controlled via a usb gamepad I had plugged in via an extra USB port gained from plugging in an old IBM USB keyboard with built-in hub.  In the second, I used ScummVM to emulate Monkey Island 2 (both of which I have purchased many, many times).  I then streamed both of these over the network to my desktop PC, simultaneously.  So, concurrently, there was USB gamepad usage, NES emulation , Scummvm emulation, 2 X servers, 2 framebuffers being compressed with jpeg and tightvnc compression, 2 remote console terminals with byobu screen and a TOP processing showing CPU usage&#8230; which never pegged out, and natually was mostly spent on the TightVNC server processes.  This gave me a bit of confidence when heading out to the store to purchase more hardware.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_860\" style=\"width: 252px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/alsamixer1.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/alsamixer1-246x300.png\" alt=\"Alsamixer on the Dockstar Debian System\" title=\"AlsaMixer on the Dockstar Debian System\" width=\"246\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-860\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/alsamixer1-246x300.png 246w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/alsamixer1.png 754w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alsamixer on the Dockstar Debian System<\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>Easy and Cheap- Audio<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first missing component on the Dockstar is audio.  I picked up a SIIC usb soundwave 7.1 soundcard for about 15 bucks at Frys.  I&#8217;ve seen similar usb audio plugs for 1$ from sites like DX and meritline, but I prefer to shop local the first go-round in case anything needs to be returned.  After pluggin it in, the dmesg log said <code>[  146.847548] usb 1-1.4: New USB device found, idVendor=0d8c, idProduct=0103<br \/>\n[  146.854467] usb 1-1.4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0<br \/>\n[  146.861822] usb 1-1.4: Product: USB Sound Device<br \/>\n[  146.867195] usb 1-1.4: Manufacturer: C-Media INC.<br \/>\n[  146.873810] usb 1-1.4: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice<br \/>\n[  147.085508] usbcore: registered new interface driver snd-usb-audio<br \/>\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Looked good to me, so I went ahead and installed alsa and some utilities with <code> apt-get install alsa alsa-utils apmd alsa-oss mpg123<\/code>  This worked without a hitch, and alsamixer showed our PCM line out.  A quick test with mpg123 determined sound was working fine, no additional setup required.  After a reboot however, this was seemingly no longer working?  I tried installing libasound2-plugins, which pulls in a good number of prerequisites,. no no avail.  Turns out a <code> \/usr\/bin\/alsa reload <\/code> was all that was required to get it working again.  So watch out for that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Getting Ready &#8211; Video<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The USB displaylink linux driver and setup has grown in leaps and bounds since last I had looked into it back in 09.  I picked up an IOGEAR USB->DVI external graphics adapter for 50$ open box at Frys (serial GUC2020DW6) as it supported 1080p out of the box.  I&#8217;ve seen these for as low as 30$, though the price fluctuates around 60$ generally.  I imagine any usb->vga or direct usb->lcd solution would also work with the same results.  That&#8217;s what&#8217;s great about running a full Debian Linux distribution on this thing, you get a world of device compatibility out of the box.  Having wrestled with a similar IOGEAR graphics adapter in the past, I was fairly confident it used the displaylink chipset and driver.  Even better, this particular USB->DVI adapter has a standard USB mini female plug on one end.  This means we won&#8217;t need to waste a port on the Dockstar, as the male USB mini plug is active and fits the adapter.  If you can&#8217;t manage to squeeze the adapter onto the plug in the current position, it is only a 5 wire cable attached to the plastic casing.  Removing the casing should resolve any spacing issues.  I just cut a small hole between the 2 existing usb ports and run the micro usb cable through there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Video, Continued<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A quick search turned up a nice tutorial on setting up USB multiseat over at <a href=\"http:\/\/plugable.com\/2009\/11\/16\/setting-up-usb-multiseat-with-displaylink-on-linux-gdm-up-to-2-20\/\">plugable.com<\/a>.  While a bit dated, I figured it was roughly analogous to the Dockstar Debian system I had running and should work.  After installing module-assistant, I decided to skip the entire tutorial and just try plugging the device into the Dockstar and a (failing) 15&#8243; vga Monitor from ancient times and seeing what happens&#8230; Success!  It was a green screen with no borders.  This means the driver is loaded and working!

These are usually along the lines of \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a laptop like that before..did you build it?\u201d (yes I did) or \u201chow did you get it to do that?\u201d (Linux, mostly). Lately, I\u2019ve had a few people comment on my somewhat unique desktop \u201cwallpaper\u201d I use on my laptop, and I thought I\u2019d do a quick tutorial for those coming in off google searches :). This is basically a 5-up devilspie embedded application background consisting of terminals, text editors, and conky. I keep these on my primary desktop in Ubuntu at all times, and this is the configuration I\u2019ve found to be optimal. Read on for the detailed setup guide and rationale behind this configuration\n\n[![\"Embedded Windows As Desktop Background](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/5updesktop1-1024x576.png \"5 Window Desktop Background\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/5updesktop1.png)\n\nNow, I know what many of you are thinking. You\u2019re thinking, \u201cwhy not just embed one huge terminal and run a 4-plex screen instance inside? I actually preferred that setup for many years, but I\u2019ve since switched to a split layout featuring a gedit window and conky. Why? Well first of all screen is an excellent screen multiplexer, but it becomes quite an involved problem when you start to squeeze oddly shaped terminal sizes together. Using devilspie to adjust each window as a separate profile is quick and allows us to load programs separately at our leisure.\n\nI also know what others are thinking. You\u2019re thinking, \u201cAre you not effectively just putting together an IDE?\u201d. It\u2019s a fair question. We are effectively embedding an IDE into the background, however the components of this IDE are highly decoupled. While one terminal may be editing a C file, another outputting from a log, and yet a third stepping through GDB, these three processes may be for completely different projects. For me at least, IDES\u2019s are of the most use when you\u2019re using all their features cohesively on a single task. While this is great when you\u2019re working on that single feature for that huge project or deadline, most of the time your attention is split three ways ten times over. And it\u2019s during this time that a decoupled interface provides the most benefit.\n\nAs it is a web-focused world, I keep a chromium instance at the ready in Desktop 2 for fast web browsing. The vast majority of my time on the computer not spent web browsing can be split into the following four activities.\n\n1. Editing Source\n2. Git Commits\n3. File Operations\n4. Writing Myself Notes\n\nAs such, I prefer to have a dedicated window for each task at the ready. In addition, I want to know the current status of the system at a glance, see the current state of the message log, and have a visual copy-paste buffer. My memory isn\u2019t what it used to be, and I tend to have 5-10 items in my copy-paste scratchpad at any one time. To fulfill each of these requirements simultaneously I need a minimum of 5 windows.\n\n1. Editing Source Window \u2013> Xterm 1\n2. Git Commits Window \u2013> Xterm 2\n3. File Operations Window \u2013> Xterm 2\n4. Message Log Window \u2013> Xterm 3\n5. Writing Myself Notes Window \u2013> gedit\n6. System Status Window \u2013> conky\n\nI\u2019ll go over the configuration of each of these in detail below. You can skip any sections that are not of interest, as the highly decoupled nature of our \u201cIDE\u201d allows us to work on each section as its own self contained tutorial. I\u2019d also be interested to hear from any of you on what layout\/configuration works best for you. For each of the below sectins, ensure you\u2019ve installed devilspie and created a devilspie directory with `sudo apt-get install devilspie && mkdir ~\/.devilspie` My desktop resolution is 1600\u00d7900, so if yours is larger\/smaller remember to adjust the below height\/width values to account for the difference in screen size. Ensure that devilspie runs on startup, and before any of the below applications (system->startup applications).\n\n**Editing Source Window \u2013> Xterm**  \n For our editing source window, I prefer a left-top window orientation (the F-shaped reading pattern). Fire up an editor, and paste the following code into `~\/.devilspie\/EditSource.ds`  \n```\n<br><\/br>\n(if<br><\/br>\n        (matches (window_name) \"EditSource\")<br><\/br>\n        (begin<br><\/br>\n                (set_workspace 1)<br><\/br>\n                (below)<br><\/br>\n                (undecorate)<br><\/br>\n                (skip_pager)<br><\/br>\n                (skip_tasklist)<br><\/br>\n                (wintype \"utility\")<br><\/br>\n                (geometry \"721x625+4+29\")<br><\/br>\n        )<br><\/br>\n)<br><\/br>```\n  \n Now just add the following line to your startup applications, after devilspie. `xterm -T \"EditSource\" bash`\n\n**Git Commits & File Operations Window \u2013> Xterm**  \n For our git commits and file log window, I prefer a right-bottom window orientation (similar to the assembly output bar in most IDEs). Fire up an editor, and paste the following code into `~\/.devilspie\/GitWindow.ds`  \n```\n<br><\/br>\n(if<br><\/br>\n        (matches (window_name) \"LogWindow\")<br><\/br>\n        (begin<br><\/br>\n                (set_workspace 1)<br><\/br>\n                (below)<br><\/br>\n                (undecorate)<br><\/br>\n                (skip_pager)<br><\/br>\n                (skip_tasklist)<br><\/br>\n                (wintype \"utility\")<br><\/br>\n                (geometry \"870x254+730+650\")<br><\/br>\n        )<br><\/br>\n)<br><\/br>```\n  \n Now just add the following line to your startup applications, after devilspie. `xterm -T \"GitWindow\" bash`\n\n**Message Log Window \u2013> Xterm**  \n For our message log window, I prefer a left-bottom window orientation (similar to the debug output bar in most IDEs). Fire up an editor, and paste the following code into `~\/.devilspie\/LogWindow.ds`  \n```\n<br><\/br>\n(if<br><\/br>\n        (matches (window_name) \"LogWindow\")<br><\/br>\n        (begin<br><\/br>\n                (set_workspace 1)<br><\/br>\n                (below)<br><\/br>\n                (undecorate)<br><\/br>\n                (skip_pager)<br><\/br>\n                (skip_tasklist)<br><\/br>\n                (wintype \"utility\")<br><\/br>\n                (geometry \"721x251+4+675\")<br><\/br>\n        )<br><\/br>\n)<br><\/br>```\n  \n Now just add the following line to your startup applications, after devilspie. `xterm -T \"LogWindow\" -e \"tail -f \/var\/log\/messages\"`\n\n**Writing Myself Notes Window \u2013> gedit**  \n For our gedit window, I prefer a middle window orientation, right in the center of things. I like to have a scratchpad open for visual copy-paste, as well as my bash_history open for quick lookup of previous commands. Fire up an editor, and paste the following code into `~\/.devilspie\/ScratchWindow.ds`  \n```\n<br><\/br>\n(if<br><\/br>\n        (is (application_name) \"gedit\")<br><\/br>\n        (begin<br><\/br>\n                (if (contains (window_name) \"scratchpad.txt\")<br><\/br>\n                (begin<br><\/br>\n                        (set_workspace 1)<br><\/br>\n                        (below)<br><\/br>\n                        (undecorate)<br><\/br>\n                        (skip_pager)<br><\/br>\n                        (skip_tasklist)<br><\/br>\n                        (wintype \"utility\")<br><\/br>\n                        (geometry \"543x615+730+29\")<br><\/br>\n                )<br><\/br>\n                )<br><\/br>\n        )<br><\/br>\n)<br><\/br>```\n  \n Now just add the following line to your startup applications, after devilspie. `gedit ~\/scratchpad.txt ~\/.bash_history`\n\n**System Status Window \u2013> conky**  \n For our conky window, I prefer a right-middle window orientation (similar to an instant message friends list). Fire up an editor, and paste the following code into `~\/.devilspie\/ConkyWindow.ds` Please note, if you have conky setup to display your hostname you\u2019ll need to change your application name to \u201cconky (yourhostname)\u201d. I prefer to leave some free space around the left side of the Conky window as some of my storage names are dynamic and can get quite long.  \n```\n<br><\/br>\n(if<br><\/br>\n        (is (application_name) \"conky\")<br><\/br>\n        (begin<br><\/br>\n                (set_workspace 1)<br><\/br>\n                (below)<br><\/br>\n                (undecorate)<br><\/br>\n                (skip_pager)<br><\/br>\n                (skip_tasklist)<br><\/br>\n                (wintype \"utility\")<br><\/br>\n                (geometry \"310x600+1290+39\")<br><\/br>\n        )<br><\/br>\n)<br><\/br>```\n  \n Now just add the following line to your startup applications, after devilspie. `conky`\n\n\n","html":"<p>While not famous in any sense of the word, I&#8217;m pretty used to having folks come up to me in public and ask me questions.

Create a nice working directory, then execute a `git clone git:\/\/notion.git.sourceforge.net\/gitroot\/notion\/notion<br><\/br>` in said directory. This will check out the Notion source code. This comes with a nice writeup on how to install. For other Ubuntu\/Debian users, it basically boils down to a quick 4-step install.\n\n1. Install Prerequisites\n2. Edit system.mk\n3. Compile and install\n4. Create an Entry for GDM\n\n**Installing Prerequisites**  \n As per the instructions on the [Notion Wiki,](http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/apps\/mediawiki\/notion\/index.php?title=Development) you\u2019re going to need to install and compile some prerequisites for Notion. If you\u2019ve done this for Ion, you should be used to the process by now. First, install the prerequisite libraries from apt with `sudo apt-get install lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libsm-dev gettext`\n\nNext, you\u2019re going to need to pull the git libraries for libtu and libextl. In the same Notion project director you created above, execute the following 2 git checkout commands. `git clone git:\/\/notion.git.sourceforge.net\/gitroot\/notion\/libtu`  \n and  \n`git clone git:\/\/notion.git.sourceforge.net\/gitroot\/notion\/libextl`  \n These check out the libtu and libextl libraries, needed by Notion (and Ion3).\n\n**Edit System.mk**  \n Edit the system.mk file that came with Notion, and uncomment the 4 Debian\/Ubuntu LUA_ variables starting on line 74. You\u2019ll also need to edit the system.mk file that came with the lbiexl library above, and uncomment the 4 Debian\/Ubuntu LUA_ variables starting on line 62.\n\n**Compile and Install**  \n First, compile and install libtu and libextl with the usual `make && sudo make install` . Once these have finished installing, you are free to proceed with the main Notion compilation.  \n Compile and install Notion with `make && sudo make install`\n\n**Adding An Entry to GDM**  \n For those of you coming from Ubuntu\/Debian and are using a GDM type login manager, you\u2019ll want a selectable entry when you login. Edit a file named `\/usr\/share\/xsessions\/notion.desktop`, and paste the following text within.  \n```\n<br><\/br>\n[Desktop Entry]<br><\/br>\nEncoding=UTF-8<br><\/br>\nName=Notion<br><\/br>\nComment=This session logs you into Notion<br><\/br>\nExec=notion<br><\/br>\nIcon=<br><\/br>\nType=Application<br><\/br>```\n\n**Day to Day Usage**  \n There are a few things that a typical Gnome desktop user may find confusing or irritating when they first startup Notion. First, if you\u2019re not attached to NetworkManager, I recommend installing WICD. It\u2019s a terrific network manager and runs without the need for a taskbar.  \n For those needing to start quickly, remember the F2, F9, and F12 keys. F2 opens a terminal into a current frame, and F12 opens the main menu at the bottom of the screen (much like vim or emacs). Frames are set locations which programs open into, in a tabbed fashion (like Chromium or Firefox). You can resize these frames with alt+right-click, though once you have a nice desktop full of frame positions this shouldn\u2019t be a common operation. Multiple pressings of F12 will cycle through the standard menu options, and the F12 run\u2026 menu allows for automatic terminal completion of actual commands. Configuration and menu entries are controlled via text files ala Fluxbox. Workspaces as a concept still remain, though they are created on the fly. Create a new workspace with F9, which you can use to tab through all available workspaces. You can also directly switch between workspaces with alt->#, where # is the workspace number. Finally, if you\u2019re constantly switching between terminals and leaving some open in screen windows etc, it\u2019d be handy if your bash history was constantly updating. Just edit your .bashrc and append `PROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -a; history -n\"` This has the added effect of enabling you to keep a window with a running log of all your shell activity for each window using `tail -f ~\/.bash_history`\n\nFor those following the previous article, you can setup the same programmer\u2019s background near instantly as follows.\n\n1. Split the Left Frame Vertically. I like to use alt + right-click to resize the windows to about the 75% mark\n2. Split the Right Frame Vertically\n3. Split the Top Right Frame Horizontally\n4. Attach Terminal (F2) to the Top Left Frame\n5. Attach Terminal (F2) to the Bottom Left Frame\n6. Attach Terminal (F2) to the Bottom Right Frame\n7. Attach gedit (F12->run\u2026->gedit) to the Center Right Frame\n8. Attach conky (F12->run\u2026->conky) to the Right Right Frame\n\nAnd that\u2019s it! Ideally, you should never really need to use the mouse for window manager operations, though typical browser and gedit copy\/pasting causes me to relapse often. Now get coding!\n\n\n","html":"<p>Following up on my previous post, NeonLicht suggested I try out the Ion window manager.

It\u2019s been one week since I finally bit the bullet and ordered a Pixel Qi trans-reflective screen from Makershed and just over one whole work day since I installed it. And what a difference a day makes. Here I sit, typing a blog post and fixing bugs, not 20 feet from the ocean. At 11am. In Los Angeles. The sun is shining brightly overhead, and I\u2019m actually getting work done on my laptop. It\u2019s fantastic. For those of you who haven\u2019t heard of the Pixel Qi screen, it\u2019s from the folks at Pixel Qi, a spinoff from the OLPC project. You can order the screen right now for 250$ on sale from Makershed and I have to say it is quite worth it, at least if you\u2019d like to get some work done in the sun. If you\u2019re smart about it, you can actually get yourself set up with a Pixel Qi enabled netbook relatively cheaply, as I did.  \n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/SprintPhoto_b5kc1n1-300x225.jpg \"Pixel Qi down by the beach\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/SprintPhoto_b5kc1n1.jpg)\n\n  \n As most of you have probably surmised by now, I\u2019m on a tight budget. Startups cost money, as do the latest gadgets and being self employed makes juggling the desire for both a tricky situation. Read my book for more on that ;). Anyway, I had heard great things about the samsung N2X0 line of laptops. 12+ hour battery life after installation and a hyperthreaded N450 cpu should be enough to carry me through an entire work day without frustration. The nice thing about buying a netbook with no interested in the screen is that you can shop in the broken section of eBay and craigslist. I picked up a Samsung N210 laptop with a broken screen a cracked bezel for 100$ off LA craigslist. The Pixel Qi LCD installation was a breeze. For 350$ total outlay, I\u2019ve got a netbook with the screen of a kindle. Screen refreshes are lightning fast, and Ubuntu\/Debian work out of the box.\n\nAnd would you look at that view! The Pixel Qi screen allows you to use your laptop places you just sinply couldn\u2019t before. While this may not be an issue in some places, here where I live coffee shops and Wifi hotspots get crowded with a capital crowd. However, there are always seats available outside, in the sun, where you can\u2019t see anything. Sitting outside the coffee shop, sipping mocha and browsing the internet, a simple pleasure. This alone may be worth the cost of entry for some, but I had loftier ambitions when I set out to build my kindlebook. (seriously we need some better words to describe these things).\n\n**The Perfect Spot**  \n So I grabbed my new epaperbook and hopped on my motorcycle and headed north up the California coast. The PCH is beautiful in the spring and the beaches are not too crowded. Heading north past Malibu, people and coffee shops begin to thin out and parking becomes plentiful. Unrolling my hammock, I walked down through a flock of bustling gulls to the beach and began to write. First on the menu, some code work.\n\nFiring up my default Notion programming desktop (from the previous articles) I started combing through an off-line copy of the TRAC database for one of our beta products looking for a good bug to fix. After finding one I figured I could knock out before my 2hr free parking window was up, I alt-#\u2019d over to my geany workspace and began to get down to business. While the coding was fine, I did notice a bit of eyestrain from all the sunlight. I realized that I had not tried to use the Pixel Qi screen while wearing sunglasses. Throwing on my HD Vision glasses (seriously, those 9.99 glasses from CVS are excellent) resolved any issues. The screen was still crystal clear, as ever.\n\n**Writing**  \n After finishing up the bug and commiting the fix to my local git repository (If you\u2019re not using commit hooks to close TRAC tickets you are missing out), I started writing this very article. It\u2019s remarkably easy to get into the flow of writing when you\u2019re surrounded by the awesome spectacle of nature, and I managed to write up today\u2019s experience with the Pixel Qi before my parking expired.\n\n**Where do we go from here?**  \n Programming and writing with the Pixel Qi screen has been a delight thus far. It absolutely sips electricity, and my battery will easily last through an eight hour coding\/debugging cycle without recharging. It\u2019s got me thinking about all of the other sunny places I\u2019d love to do work, and may post up some of the fun places I go. From debugging on top of a mountain, coding in the desert, to programming on my roof; the sky\u2019s the limit. A terrific implementation and a truly groundbreaking device.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Quite the dramatic lead-in, I know.

If you&#8217;re smart about it, you can actually get yourself set up with a Pixel Qi enabled netbook relatively cheaply, as I did.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/SprintPhoto_b5kc1n1.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/SprintPhoto_b5kc1n1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Pixel Qi down by the beach\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" align=\"left\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><br \/>\nAs most of you have probably surmised by now, I&#8217;m on a tight budget.  Startups cost money, as do the latest gadgets and being self employed makes juggling the desire for both a tricky situation.  Read my book for more on that ;).  Anyway, I had heard great things about the samsung N2X0 line of laptops.  12+ hour battery life after installation and a hyperthreaded N450 cpu should be enough to carry me through an entire work day without frustration.  The nice thing about buying a netbook with no interested in the screen is that you can shop in the broken section of eBay and craigslist.  I picked up a Samsung N210 laptop with a broken screen a cracked bezel for 100$ off LA craigslist.  The Pixel Qi LCD installation was a breeze.  For 350$ total outlay, I&#8217;ve got a netbook with the screen of a kindle.  Screen refreshes are lightning fast, and Ubuntu\/Debian work out of the box.  <\/p>\n<p>And would you look at that view!  The Pixel Qi screen allows you to use your laptop places you just sinply couldn&#8217;t before.  While this may not be an issue in some places, here where I live coffee shops and Wifi hotspots get crowded with a capital crowd.  However, there are always seats available outside, in the sun, where you can&#8217;t see anything.  Sitting outside the coffee shop, sipping mocha and browsing the internet, a simple pleasure.  This alone may be worth the cost of entry for some, but I had loftier ambitions when I set out to build my kindlebook.  (seriously we need some better words to describe these things).<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Perfect Spot<\/strong><br \/>\nSo I grabbed my new epaperbook and hopped on my motorcycle and headed north up the California coast.  The PCH is beautiful in the spring and the beaches are not too crowded.  Heading north past Malibu, people and coffee shops begin to thin out and parking becomes plentiful.  Unrolling my hammock, I walked down through a flock of bustling gulls to the beach and began to write.  First on the menu, some code work.<\/p>\n<p>Firing up my default Notion programming desktop (from the previous articles) I started combing through an off-line copy of the TRAC database for one of our beta products looking for a good bug to fix.  After finding one I figured I could knock out before my 2hr free parking window was up, I alt-#&#8217;d over to my geany workspace and began to get down to business.   While the coding was fine, I did notice a bit of eyestrain from all the sunlight.  I realized that I had not tried to use the Pixel Qi screen while wearing sunglasses.  Throwing on my HD Vision glasses (seriously, those 9.99 glasses from CVS are excellent) resolved any issues.  The screen was still crystal clear, as ever.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writing<\/strong><br \/>\nAfter finishing up the bug and commiting the fix to my local git repository (If you&#8217;re not using commit hooks to close TRAC tickets you are missing out), I started writing this very article.  It&#8217;s remarkably easy to get into the flow of writing when you&#8217;re surrounded by the awesome spectacle of nature, and I managed to write up today&#8217;s experience with the Pixel Qi before my parking expired.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do we go from here?<\/strong><br \/>\nProgramming and writing with the Pixel Qi screen has been a delight thus far.  It absolutely sips electricity, and my battery will easily last through an eight hour coding\/debugging cycle without recharging.  It&#8217;s got me thinking about all of the other sunny places I&#8217;d love to do work, and may post up some of the fun places I go.  From debugging on top of a mountain, coding in the desert, to programming on my roof; the sky&#8217;s the limit.  A terrific implementation and a truly groundbreaking device.  <\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 04 Mar 2011 15:29:06 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 04 Mar 2011 15:29:06 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 04 Mar 2011 15:29:06 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1039,"title":"Secure SSH Terminal in your Steam Overlay","slug":"secure-ssh-terminal-in-your-steam-overlay","markdown":"\nHere\u2019s a fun thing I came up with for those Steam users out there. Ever wanted to use an SSH client in the middle of a Steam game? I\u2019ve got an arm based server running constantly at my house (4 watts average power usage) doing menial chores like downloading and file serving and queuing up print jobs, playing music, etc. I prefer to SSH into a screen or byobu session, start a long task, then disconnect and check back later. If you\u2019re relaxing at home playing a game in Steam however, you may not want to alt-tab out of your game session. Besides, if you\u2019re running in Wine there\u2019s a fairly good chance this will crash your game in some fashion. Short of booting up another computer or opening ports on your router to allow web-based ssh services to work, what is one to do? Read on for my solution to the problem.  \n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/IMG_68921-300x225.jpg \"Terminal In Steam\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/IMG_68921.jpg)\n\nSteam is great. They keep adding new features, they have consistent and heavily discounted game sales, and they have a great shift-tab interface which allows you to open a steam browser window or take a screenshot of your game. I like the open source alternative [Taksi ](http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/taksi\/files\/)for taking screenshots myself, but that\u2019s just me. What Steam does not offer is an ssh client or terminal. Though there are web based ssh solutions you can never really trust their security if you\u2019re not running the service yourself, and who wants to open up ports to an outside service? I prefer to keep everything inside a local subnet.\n\nThis is where [Anyterm ](http:\/\/anyterm.org\/download\/index.html)comes in handy. It\u2019s a GPL webservice that gives you a console. As you compile it from source, I didn\u2019t have any trouble compiling it on my debian-based ARM server. The steps are pretty straightforward. However it can be even simpler than that. After setting up Anyterm I stumbled across [Ajaxterm](http:\/\/antony.lesuisse.org\/software\/ajaxterm\/), a similar program with a much easier installation. I\u2019ll run you through the installation for Ajaxterm below, with the installation for AnyTerm at the bottom of the article for anyone not wishing to run python on their server.  \n**Installation of Ajaxterm (The Easy Way)**\n\n1. Install prerequisites with `sudo apt-get install python`\n2. Download and extract Ajaxterm with `wget http:\/\/antony.lesuisse.org\/software\/ajaxterm\/files\/Ajaxterm-0.10.tar.gz && tar -xvzf Ajaxterm*.tar.gz `\n3. If you want to connect from other machines on your network without bothering with SSL (dangerous, you can still set up an stunnel as I show below), you can edit the file ajaxterm.py, and change \u201clocalhost\u201d to be \u201cIP_OF_YOUR_AJAXTERM_BOX\u201d on line 560\n4. Likewise, if you\u2019d like to fiddle with the terminal rows\/cols size you can directly edit the w\/h variables on line 499\n5. Execute the server daemon with `.\/ajaxterm.py -d -c 'bash'` This will keep a daemon running locally till you reboot your machine.\n6. On any computer with access to your machine\u2019s IP, fire up steam and open up the game browser. Head on over to `http:\/\/IP_OF_YOUR_AJAXTERM_BOX:8022` and you\u2019ll be terminally happy\n\n**Installation of Anyterm (The Hard Way)**\n\n1. Install pre-requisites with `apt-get install zlib1g-dev libboost-dev stunnel4` (stunnel4 is optional)\n2. Get the source code from subversion or a tarball, I pulled the latest copy from their subversion repository with `svn co http:\/\/svn.anyterm.org\/anyterm\/tags\/releases\/1.1\/1.1.29\/ anyterm-1.1.29`\n3. Compile the anytermd daemon with `make` If smtpclient.cc fails to compile, just add a `#include <cstdio> `\n4. Copy the resulting anytermd executable somewhere, and make sure you have permission to run it.\n5. I recommend tunneling through stunnel4 as described on the [anyterm installation page](http:\/\/anyterm.org\/1.1\/install.html), otherwise you can ignore anything related to stunnel\n6. Generate your SSL certificate for stunnel with the following commands `openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 365 -out stunnel.pem -keyout stunnel.pem`  \n`dd if=\/dev\/urandom of=temp_file count=2`  \n`openssl dhparam -rand temp_file 512 >> stunnel.pem`  \n` ln -sf stunnel.pem `openssl x509 -noout -hash <br><\/br>chmod 600 stunnel.pem`\n7. Start the anytermd daemon with `anytermd  -p 4567--user=YOURUSERNAME -c 'bash'` This will spawn a daemon in the background, which will continue running till reboot.\n8. Start the stunnel proxy server with `stunnel -d 6789 -r 4567 -p stunnel.pem -P ''` This will also spawn a daemon that will run till you reboot.\n9. Now, on any computer with access to this machine's IP, fire up steam and shif-tab into a browser. Enter `https:\/\/IP_OF_YOUR_ANYTERMD_BOX:6789\/` and you're ready to administrate while gaming \ud83d\ude42\n\n\n","html":"<p>Here&#8217;s a fun thing I came up with for those Steam users out there.

As such, I\u2019ve gotten the banhammer from Sony PSN networks, and if I want to play some multiplayer games with my PS3, I\u2019m out of luck except for LAN play. This is fine, as there\u2019s always tunneling applications such as Xlink Kai, or so I thought. It\u2019s been quite a while since I last looked into XLink Kai. This article was originally going to be titled \u201cXlink Kai Arm Port\u201d, however the XLink Kai developers have decided to close source their project. That\u2019s their prerogative and if they feel it contributes to the quality of their project it\u2019s within their purveyance to do so. That said, it just doesn\u2019t jive with me. One can argue the effectiveness of closed source solutions but at the end of the day Xlink Kai would have had a fully working ARM port working on all the billions of Arm devices today if they had left their source open, because I would have ported it this weekend.\n\nAnyway, things being what they are I decided to get their main competitor (XBSLink) running on the ARM platform. Some of the ps3 [hacker](http:\/\/www.ps3-hacks.com\/2011\/03\/19\/alternatives-to-psn-game-online-elsewhere\/) [blogs ](http:\/\/www.ps3hax.net\/2011\/03\/no-psn-try-xbslink-v0-9-2-0\/)have been talking about XBSLink lately, and I thought it\u2019d be an optimal application for a little ARM box (a pogoplog perhaps). This will allow you to run the XBSLink daemon on your ARM based Linux box (hopefully pulling 4 watts or less like mine is) and save you the hassle of running a full 400 watt multi core many gigahertz PC for a frikkin port forwarding application. Read on for the setup tutorial. I had gone into this article prepared to walk you through a full compilation and porting tutorial, but it turns out it\u2019s not necessary. Read on for the full guide!\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/XBSLink1-300x189.png \"XBSLink\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/XBSLink1.png)\n\n**Install Prerequisites**  \n XBSLink requires mono and libpcap, so install them with `apt-get install libpcap-dev mono-runtime libmono-* mono-winforms*`\n\n**Snag the executable**  \n Create a directory for XBSLink and pull the newest Linux tarball with `wget  http:\/\/www.secudb.de\/~seuffert\/xbslink\/downloads\/36`\n\n**Find the Capture Device**  \n After extracting the executable, execute it with `sudo mono XBSlink.exe -l` to list your capture devices. In my case I\u2019ll use eth0 as the capture device, the first Ethernet port. You\u2019ll also want to find your ipaddress with ifconfig, as you\u2019ll need to pass this value to XBSLink.\n\n**Starting the XBSLink Service \u2013 Looking for Clouds**  \n The XBSLink service works by creating private \u201cclouds\u201d of folks in a virtual network. You can list the currently running clouds (and thus the games you can join) once you connect to the service as follows. You\u2019ll need to pass your ip address, the capture device to use, and your nickname to the XBSLink service. You\u2019ll probably also want to use UPNP services, so you\u2019ll enable that with the -u parameter. In my case the ip address of my ARM device was 10.10.0.175, so my command line was `sudo mono XBSlink.exe -u -i eth0 -o 10.10.0.175 -n huntergdavis` Once this is up and running, press c to list the available clouds. Also note the UPNP address that XBSLink maps to, you\u2019ll specify this in your PS3 cloud name (in my case 192.168.1.47). Also note all these PS3 workaround are both temporary and not necessary for use with the Xbox 360.\n\n**Caveats and Workarounds for PS3**  \n You\u2019ll notice that when you list the clouds that PS3 related clouds have their IP address in the cloud name. Currently PS3 systems need to be on the same subnet to play LAN games together. There\u2019s a workaround in progress by the developer, but for now you\u2019ll need to join clouds which have the same subnet as your PS3 (or create your own cloud and let others do the network switcharoo).\n\n**Creating your Cloud and Playing Online**  \n And that\u2019s that. Say you wanted to start up a game of Homefront on the PS3 and let others play with you. Just start up a cloud (specifying your external IP address so others can play with you!) with the following command:  \n` sudo mono XBSlink.exe -u -i eth0 -o 192.168.0.175 -n huntergdavis -c \"PS3 Homefront IP 192.168.1.47\"`\n\n\n","html":"<p>As someone who hacks up every console he&#8217;s ever gotten, my PS3 has been rocking a Linux enabled CFW for some time now (remember <a href=\"http:\/\/hunterdavis.com\/archives\/125\">that tutorial<\/a> I did way back on turning your Linux PS3 into a cross-compilation powerhouse?).

That\u2019s particularly interesting, as the product image for the sensorbar on that page shows the original design. Four of the LEDs have been removed internally, meaning there are only three IR emitters on each side of the sensor bar. This is good news, as it means we no longer need the 7.5v line coming down from the wii, and should be able to get by with anywhere from 4.5 to 7 volts. As such, a stock usb line will work.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_baexg51-300x225.jpg \"3 LED Wii Sensor Bar\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_baexg51.jpg)\n\nTake that pair of scissors I mentioned, and snip the sensorbar cable.

Like most of the higher end tablets though, it\u2019s pricey and easy to recognize. This makes it a pretty choice target for thieves. Rather than lower the usability of the device and leave it at home, I set out to disguise the tablet in some fashion. After browsing through the tablet cases available, I figured I could do just as well by building a hide-a-book. And that\u2019s what I did! Read on for the full tutorial.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bugam41-300x225.jpg \"Hide-A-Tablet Book\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bugam41.jpg)\n\n**Finding the Right Book**\n\nHeading out to the local thrift shop, I found a faux Victorian photo album that was slightly larger than my tablet. Photo books work well as they have fewer and thicker pages, which means less gluing overall.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bvu1jy1-300x225.jpg \"The Cover\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bvu1jy1.jpg)\n\n**Sizing The Pages For Cutting**\n\nI like to leave a page or two uncut in the back or the front of the book so you can flip some pages or keep a bookmark in there for fun. Find the first page you want cut, and use a graphite pencil to stencil the perimeter of the tablet. You\u2019ll want to angle the pencil towards the inside of the tablet, so you have a nice 1 cm buffer around your tablet. This prevents you from having to do a lot of manual sanding after gluing.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bjdx2y1-300x225.jpg \"Sizing the Pages for Cutting\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bjdx2y1.jpg)\n\n**Cutting The Pages**\n\nUsing your sharpest knife, make strong downward strokes along the graphite lines. For thin cardboard like you\u2019d find in photo albums, it\u2019s going to take a couple of strokes per page. Repeatedly cut along the lines using the previous pages as a guide. If you\u2019re worried about cutting up the inside of your cover, a thin layer of cardboard or wood placed behind your cover will prevent any out of bounds cuts. I like to cut 99% of each line, then pop each individual page out one at a time. This works less well for very large books with thin pages (and I\u2019ve seen a couple of hide-a-bibles).\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_befuoy1-300x225.jpg \"cutting the pages\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_befuoy1.jpg)\n\n**Gluing the Pages**\n\nUsing a tooth-pick, gently apply glue to the outer rim of the pages that you wish to glue (usually the ones you cut). You don\u2019t want to gob too much up, or you\u2019ll end up with glue spillover and it\u2019ll detract from the realism of your book. This can be resolved with a bit of sandpaper, and applying a new outer finish to the pages if you like.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bs2lt31-300x225.jpg \"Setting the Glue with Toothpicks\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bs2lt31.jpg)\n\n**Letting the Glue Dry**\n\nAfter gluing all of the pages, most glues will require a bit of time to set before being put to use (or sanded down). I recommend clamping and weighing your book during this process. If you don\u2019t have a small set of clamps, do yourself a favor and pick some up at a hardware store for a couple bucks. While a stack of books is excellent for applying pressure over your book in a general fashion, you need to apply extra pressure to the spine and the outer-rim of a hide-a-book, as any spine glue or page thickness mismatches can cause trouble in the gluing department. Best to clamp them down before setting up your book (or any weight) tower.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bh4bf51-300x225.jpg \"Letting the Glue Dry\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bh4bf51.jpg)\n\n**Sanding**\n\nAfter a few hours (or whatever is recommended by your glue manufacturer) you\u2019ll be left with a hollowed out shell of a book. If you\u2019re like me there will be some rough edges (and probably a few spots of glue) to be sanded off the inside and outside of the pages. I recommend just taking a cheap fine-grain sandpaper and hand-wiping the sections in question. A hand dremel with a polishing or buffing tip would also work well.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bdl0pg1-300x225.jpg \"Lets Get Ready To Sand!\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bdl0pg1.jpg)\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bex2lu1-300x225.jpg \"Sanding\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bex2lu1.jpg)\n\n**Finishing Up**\n\nNow that you\u2019ve sanded out all the rough edges, it\u2019s time to test your tablet for fitting. Depending on your make of tablet you may want to sand or cut out an indentation to keep your power button from depressing.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_btusaw1-300x225.jpg \"Finished Product?\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_btusaw1.jpg)\n\n**Felt (Felting?)**\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a screen protector on your tablet you may want to line the inside of your hide-a-book with felt or another screen-safe material to prevent screen scratching. I like a nice white felt as it can\u2019t be seen from the outside of the book when its closed. From here, you\u2019re pretty much finished. If there are any rough spots just apply a bit of light sanding, maybe a touch of paint or a signature, and you\u2019re done!\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bz20v31-300x225.jpg \"Felt Covering\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bz20v31.jpg)\n\n\n","html":"<p>As you probably already know, I&#8217;ve got quite a thing for mobile devices.

Best to clamp them down before setting up your book (or any weight) tower.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bh4bf51.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bh4bf51-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Letting the Glue Dry\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"  \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sanding<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After a few hours (or whatever is recommended by your glue manufacturer) you&#8217;ll be left with a hollowed out shell of a book.  If you&#8217;re like me there will be some rough edges (and probably a few spots of glue) to be sanded off the inside and outside of the pages.  I recommend just taking a cheap fine-grain sandpaper and hand-wiping the sections in question.  A hand dremel with a polishing or buffing tip would also work well.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bdl0pg1.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bdl0pg1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Lets Get Ready To Sand!\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1217\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bdl0pg1-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bdl0pg1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bdl0pg1-400x300.jpg 400w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bdl0pg1.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bex2lu1.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bex2lu1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sanding\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1220\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bex2lu1-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bex2lu1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bex2lu1-400x300.jpg 400w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/SprintPhoto_bex2lu1.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Finishing Up<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve sanded out all the rough edges, it&#8217;s time to test your tablet for fitting.

While the amount of skill required to play my games is certainly questionable, I think a standard nomenclature helps folks when searching for your other items.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/hunterdavis.com\/android-game-skillful-lines\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot231-180x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"screenshot2\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1933\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot231-180x300.png 180w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot231.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can learn more about Skillful Lines from the permalink page <a href=\"http:\/\/hunterdavis.com\/android-game-skillful-lines\">here<\/a>, or download Skillful Lines from the Android Market <a href=\"https:\/\/market.android.com\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.skillfullines\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 17:33:38 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 17:33:38 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 17:33:38 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1940,"title":"Skillful Surround","slug":"android-game-skillful-surround","markdown":"\nSkillful Surround is a fast and addicting game of skill for the Android.

You can also now view your current spell and item lists from the menu button!<\/p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot361.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot361-180x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"screenshot3\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2186\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot361-180x300.png 180w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot361.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot41.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot41-180x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"screenshot4\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2187\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot41-180x300.png 180w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot41.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot51.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot51-180x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"screenshot5\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2188\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot51-180x300.png 180w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/screenshot51.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<p>Read all about it on the permalink page <a href=\"http:\/\/hunterdavis.com\/android-game-the-grind\">here<\/a>, or download it from the Android Market <a href=\"https:\/\/market.android.com\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.thegrind\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 01 Aug 2011 12:06:38 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 01 Aug 2011 12:06:38 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 01 Aug 2011 12:06:38 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":2194,"title":"Splitting It Down The Middle - Book Prices at 4.99 Starting Midnight August 2nd","slug":"splitting-it-down-the-middle-book-prices-at-4-99-starting-midnight-august-2nd","markdown":"\nSo after my decision to up my book prices to 9.99, sales dropped by more than 70 percent.

For some programmers out there, the real barrier of entry to market seems to be a lack of knowledge on how to add AdMob and Adsense to your application, and how to publish it on the Android Market. It can be a bit of a pain, but once you\u2019ve got it down it\u2019s a straightforward process. I\u2019ve written a detailed tutorial for those who\u2019d rather not have to figure all this out from scratch.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/moneyall1-300x225.jpg \"moneyall\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/moneyall1.jpg)\n\nRead on for the full 25 step guide to adding ads and publishing your Android app to market.\n\n1. Step 1 is, of course, to actually write an Android app. Check out my [YouTube channel](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/huntergdavis) for a nice video to help you along with that.\n2. Write out a nice description for your app in a word processor. No spelling mistakes! You\u2019ll paste this description all over, so make sure it\u2019s good.\n3. Register a new android app on admob.com. You\u2019ll need the description you wrote above.\n4. On the AdMob site, set admob.com->app name->app settings->google adsense to TRUE. I also like to set a 60 second ad refresh timeout.\n5. Before exiting AdMob, copy out the publisher ID for this particular Android app. It\u2019ll be a long hash string on the top of the page when you click on the program details in your dashboard.\n6. Open Eclipse (or your editor of choice), and open up your Android project directory.\n7. Make sure your Manifest file has your correct project name i.e. com.hunterdavis.easycatwhistle. One accepted general format is com.publisher.program.\n8. Ensure the Manifest file has correct permissions for and file or hardware access and specifies a minimum api level (I generally use 7 or above)\n9. The ads will be dynamic, so also ensure your Manifest has network access permissions\n10. Add your AdMob activity line into your Manifest file. It will be of the form ``\n11. In your main.xml file (and any other layouts you wish to have ads in), paste in your adsense xlns namespace. It\u2019ll look like: `xmlns:ads=\"http:\/\/schemas.android.com\/apk\/lib\/com.google.ads\"`\n12. In your main.xml file (and any other layouts you wish to have ads in), paste in your adsense resource id and widget code. It\u2019ll look like: ``\n13. In your activities java file, add an ad network request during your activities oncreate function. It\u2019ll look like ```\nAdView adView = (AdView) this.findViewById(R.id.adView);<br><\/br>\n\t\tadView.loadAd(new AdRequest());```\n14. Open up your favorite editor and create a 512\u00d7512 PNG hires image. Draw what you like, as it\u2019ll be the icon for your program. I like to save it into a \u201cdeploy\u201d folder as icon.png\n15. Now you need to generate the 3 levels of icon files Android requires. You can either do this manually, or have http:\/\/www.androidicongenerator.net do it for you. Save each of these 3 icons generated into the res folder (high medium and low), replacing the default icon.png files that get generated by the SDK.\n16. Copy the description of your app from above into a blog post or permalink page. You can use this as the website link during the publishing step.\n17. Execute your app in a high-res emulator (like the 800\u00d7600 one that comes with the SDK), and take two Screenshots of your app. (Camera button on device menu in Eclipse)\n18. Upload these screenshots to the blog post or permalink page you created earlier.\n19. Use the Android tools menu in Eclipse (or the SDK command line tools, etc) to generate a signed application package. It\u2019ll require that you type in your publisher name and location, as well as set a password for your encryption.\n20. *Optional \u2013 Test your signed application package on a real live device. I use swiftp on the Android, filezilla on the PC, and easy file manager on the Android. Upload the package to somewhere you can browse to it on your Android device over ftp (or USB or whatever) and ensure your program looks good with ads and rotation etc.\n21. Upload the signed package, icon, screenshots, and fancy description to the Android market and click publish.\n22. Find your Market page, it\u2019ll be of the form `market.android.com\/details?id=com.YOURPUBLISHER.YOURAPPNAME`\n23. Link to your market page from your blog post or permalink page.\n24. Post your market page, blog post, or permalink page to Facebook, Reddit, Hacker News, Google+, what have you!\n25. Profit!\n\n\n","html":"<p>I had a YouTube comment a while back ask me for the source code to one of my games, simply so that he could figure out how to add AdMob ads to his own game.

I guess we all do now, what with Android and iPhone tearing up the sales numbers. That said, I\u2019ve never before had the guts to try and replace my aging Sony Dream Theater stereo system that\u2019s hooked up to my beloved record player. Although the sound quality coming off the head unit is quite good (I replaced the speakers long ago with some good ones), it only has two extra inputs and no support for internet streaming or mp3 playback etc. I\u2019d also like to be able to use standard remote controls (Sony HATES standards), Bluetooth devices, cell phones, network control, etc. Although I\u2019m using the Dockstar, this tutorial would generically apply to any Debian (arm or otherwise) system. Read on for the first part in my new walkthrough series entitled \u201cUsing the Dockstar as a full Home Theater Replacement\u201d:\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/PICT00081-300x225.jpg \"dockstar\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/PICT00081.jpg)\n\nIf you haven\u2019t flashed your Dockstar with Linux yet, check out [Jeff Doozan](http:\/\/jeff.doozan.com\/debian\/)\u2018s script on it, and my [previous article](http:\/\/hunterdavis.com\/archives\/843) on the subject. I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re using a base Debian system from here out.\n\n**Basic Stereo Support and local file support**\n\nThe first step is to set up some basic audio support on your device. If your device has an audio port already, you can skip adding a usb audio device. Otherwise, plug in your usb audio-out and check that your dmesg log shows it being recognized. Every one I have tried is recognized without an issue, and I have tried dozens. I am starting to think they are all pretty standardized. Add a user to your system. I know this seems off to many embedded folks but logging in as root is a bad idea for anything on the network. Make sure your user is in the audio, cdrom, and dialout groups, as well as any admin groups you want them in. Pull in some basic prerequisites for a networked audio system with\n\n```\napt-get install alsa alsa-utils apmd alsa-oss mpg123 libasound2-plugins git alsa-headers build-essential sudo<br><\/br>\nnfs-kernel-server nfs-common alsa-base alsaplayer alsaplayer-text alsa-utils libasound2 vlc```\n\nThis will pull in some basic media players and the alsa architecture. If your USB audio is like mine, the levels will be off. Edit a file called \/etc\/asound.conf, and paste [the attached text](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/plainpcmfile.txt) This will up the levels. Reboot your system, then immediately open up alsamixer and drop the levels down to 80% each. The right level will take a LOT of down arrow presses, so don\u2019t think that it isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s actually just going through a larger volume level that\u2019s being scaled down to 100% by alsamixer.\n\n**Networked Digital Music**\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve already got a NFS or Samba share set up on your network. While there\u2019s nothing abnormal about setting up NFS on an embedded system versus any other, if you\u2019re uninitiated it\u2019s a pretty esoteric process. It basically boils down to setting up a client and a server. We\u2019ll want to run both on this system, as we\u2019ll want to stream in NFS shares from across the network, and we\u2019ll want to share whatever is plugged into this over the network. To set up the client, we\u2019ll simply add entries to our \/etc\/fstab in the following format.\n\n` IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER:\/share\/sharedir     \/localdir\/localsharedir   nfs     defaults        0      0`\n\nTo set up the server, we\u2019ll simply add entries to our \/etc\/exports in the following format.\n\n`\/srv\/nfs4\/homes  gss\/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)`\n\nAfter a reboot, you should be sharing and seeing your shares from the network in your mounted locations. Make sure you\u2019ve created directories for the mounts beforehand, or they\u2019ll fail during automount.\n\n**RSD Remote Audio Server**\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vlcncurses1-300x223.png \"vlcncurses\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vlcncurses1.png)\n\nVLC comes with a nice ncurses interface you can use for testing audio playback. Just execute `vlc -I ncurses` from any terminal and you\u2019ll get the ncurses interface. Shift-B gives you a nice file browser ala DOS. At this point you should be able to SSH into your box and play audio files from the command line interface.\n\n**VNC and Window Maker**\n\nCommand line interfaces are great, as are SSH terminals\u2026 but there\u2019s a lot to be said for a nice graphical playlist manager. VNC is a nice lightweight way to keep one of these playlist managers open, so we\u2019ll go ahead and install that with\n\n` sudo apt-get install tightvncserver xorg`\n\nFrom here, give yourself a vnc password by executing `vncpasswd` It\u2019ll ask for a view-only password as well. This is optional, but pretty handy for VJ-ing and screen sharing. Now simply execute a vnc session for your user with `vncserver`.\n\nNow on whatever box you\u2019re going to VNC in from, install a VNC viewer. If you\u2019re using windows or another platform which supports java, I recommend the [new beta](http:\/\/www.tightvnc.com\/ssh-java-vnc-viewer.php) of tightvnc+ssh (java). It\u2019s recent, has built-in ssh tunnelling (which improves both overhead and security), and is cross-platform. Install your client, then connect to your arm box using the password you just created. You\u2019re going to see a plain X desktop with a single console. I first recommend installing aptitude, as it\u2019ll make finding new packages much easier visually.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vnc1-300x243.png \"vnc\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vnc1.png)\n\nNext I strongly recommend installing a better window manager. [Window Maker](http:\/\/windowmaker.org\/) is quite good, and I haven\u2019t featured it yet in a hack. I like to rotate through window managers to give em all some love. You can install it with `sudo apt-get install wmaker `\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/betterdesktop1-300x243.png \"betterdesktop\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/betterdesktop1.png)\n\n**A Side Note About Conky**\n\nOk so the biggest issue with the dockstar is it\u2019s limited (128mb) memory. This isn\u2019t such a huge deal, as many of us grew up with computers which had far less memory. It does mean we have to keep an eye on our memory usage though. For some unknown reason, I could not find conky in the debian arm repository. Gnome-system-monitor is in there and works fine, but takes up a whopping 20% of the CPU when its generating graphs. Not really acceptable. So I set out to compile [conky](http:\/\/conky.sourceforge.net\/). If you like conky too, just\n\n1. Create a directory in which to compile conky, and change into that directory\n2. Init the directory with `git init`\n3. Pull conky with `git clone git:\/\/git.omp.am\/conky.git`\n4. Change to the subdirectory conky\n5. Create a directory called build, and change into that directory\n6. Install the prerequisites for conky with `sudo apt-get install cmake liblua5.1 liblua5.1-dev libx11-dev cmake-gui libpthread-stubs0-dev libfreetype6-dev libxft-dev gawk ncurses-dev libncurses-* xmms2 libxdamage-dev libxext-dev `\n7. You could execute the cmake pre-build with `cmake ..\/` , but I prefer to disable a ton of features I won\u2019t need. Just open up cmake-gui and point it at the conky directory. Then disable almost everything. I leave math, music players, xmms2, xdamage, freetype, and the x11 options checked. Everything else I get rid of. If you want more feature, there may be additional prerequisites not listed here.\n8. Change into the build directory of conky, and execute a `make`\n9. Execute a `sudo make install` this will install conky into the system for user access\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/conkyrunning1-300x241.png \"conkyrunning\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/conkyrunning1.png)\n\n<strongheavyweight managers=\"\" playlist=\"\"><\/strongheavyweight>\n\nOk, since we know Xmms installs and runs, we may as well see how far we can push it. I set out to see exactly how large a playlist I can add to Audacious (a lightweight xmms2\/beep-based media player) without filling up all the memory. Unfortunately Audacious segfaults. So I went about compiling [Beep](http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/beepmp\/) from source, just so I\u2019d have it. The following is therefore optional. This had a few prerequisites, which were taken care of with a `sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-* xorg-dev xserver-xorg-dev sqlite3 libstartup-notification* libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglade2-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libneon27-dev libnotify-dev glibmm* gamin libgamin-dev libmusicbrainz4-dev libtaglib* libsqlite3-dev  libhal-storage-dev libhal-dev<br><\/br>` Simply extract the Beep source file, execute the classic `.\/configure && make &&sudo make install` , and you\u2019re good to go. If it fails to compile, it\u2019s because of a reference to an old PRIVATE_ variable in gtk. Simply delete the offending line (103 in widgets\/bmp_tooltips.c). You may also need to add `#include <cstdlib><\/cstdlib>` for any file which complains about memcpy not being defined, or `#include <cstring><\/cstring>` for any file which complains about strlen. After all that, and quite a bit of time for compilation and linking, everything should compile fine.

It is actually a pretty terrific program, even on embedded arm boards. You can literally play a 480p video stream on the arm board, and stream the video over VNC at a reasonable rate. On a whim I decided to use a more heavyweight audio player \u201cbanshee\u201d. It actually seemed to fit well into the memory profile, so I pointed it at a 40 gig music share on an nfs drive and told it to \u201cimport\u201d. It took awhile (at least an hour, it was late and I passed out. The beauty of a 6 watt arm device is not worrying too much about the carbon offset), and at times about 200 megs of swap, but it finished. And I had a 40gig mp3 collection in a full featured audio player over the network. Not a bad start, but there\u2019s too much processing power in our laptops and mobile devies nowadays to waste it all while an arm box does decoding. Another, (one of many) less memory and processing intensive solution is remote audio playback.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/banshee2-300x242.png \"banshee\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/banshee2.png)\n\n**Compiling and Testing rSound **\n\n[rSound ](https:\/\/github.com\/Themaister\/RSound)is a terrific project from Themaister which aims to be a lightweight networked sound server\/client. It has support for all windows, OSX, and unix-based platforms and is built into a number of PS3 emulators. You have to compile the server from source, but it\u2019s fairly straightforward.\n\n1. Create a new directory for your rsound project, and init it with `git init`\n2. Pull the rSound git repository with `git pull https:\/\/github.com\/Themaister\/RSound.git`\n3. Execute a `.\/configure` This should say alsa and alsa headers are installed. If not, double check your apt-get from above completed and you have all headers necessary\n4. Execute a `make`\n5. Execute a `sudo make install`\n6. Edit the following file as root `sudo vim \/etc\/init.d\/rsd`\n7. Paste in the following code, changing YOUR_IP_ADDRESS to your device\u2019s ip address  \n```\n<br><\/br>\n#!\/bin\/sh<br><\/br>\n\/usr\/local\/bin\/rsd --resampler 5 --syslog --daemon<br><\/br>```\n8. Make this file executable with `sudo chmod 755 \/etc\/init.d\/rsd`\n9. Make it run on startup with `sudo update-rc.d rsd defaults 80`\n10. Reboot\n\nAt this point, RSD (the rSound daemon) has been installed on your embedded arm box. It has a built-in resampler which will resample any audio up to the maximum setting (5). Installing it on a Linux system is the same process, so I\u2019ll describe installing in on a windows box, and using it with the media player classic client. This only uses about 15% of cpu at any given time, so is pretty efficient.\n\n**Remote Sound with Media Player Classic**\n\nDownload the rSound for windows library files from [here](http:\/\/blackbird.usask.ca\/wordpress\/?p=327). Download media player classic (32-bit) from [here](http:\/\/mpc-hc.sourceforge.net\/). I prefer to download the .zip file version, as you can have a local version which contains the rSound dlls on hand for easily moving between systems and virtual machines. Extract the media player classic zip you just downloaded into a folder. If you wish to use the 64-bit version of a program, you\u2019ll need to compile a 64-bit version of the rSound windows library from source [here](http:\/\/blackbird.usask.ca\/wordpress\/?p=327). Next extract the contents of the rSound library zip into that same folder. Make sure there were no sub-folders created by mistake, as you\u2019ll want all these files in the same directory.\n\nIn your windows control panel, open up the system panel. Inside the system panel, go to advanced system settings, then click on environment variables. Click \u201cnew\u201d, and enter `RSD_SERVER` as the name field, and the IP address of your arm system as the value field. Click \u201cnew\u201d again, and enter `RSD_LATENCY` as the name field, and `200ms` as the value field. I chose 200 as my arm box is behind 2 wireless bridges and at least two hops from all my other devices. This tends to incur some network latency, and let\u2019s not even talk about interference. Anyway, reboot your system. When it fires back up, open media player classic and go to the options->output options menu. Select \u201cdirectsound \u2013 rSound networked audio\u201d as the output device.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/rsound1-300x248.png \"rsound\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/rsound1.png)\n\nAnd that\u2019s that. You can now stream sound from most every application on your PC to your arm box. And this is just the beginning. For the time being, the Sony system is still being used as an amplifier, and to switch between signals and control audio. In future articles I\u2019ll talk about adding remote support (bluetooth, wifi, infrared, etc), multiple audio-in and audio-out options, stereo re-mixing, auto-streaming, timers, power control, amplifiers, LCD and video out, and so much more!\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/success1-300x194.png \"success\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/success1.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>As you&#8217;re probably already aware if you are reading this, I&#8217;ve got a thing for embedded systems.  I guess we all do now, what with Android and iPhone tearing up the sales numbers.

I&#8217;m going to assume you&#8217;re using a base Debian system from here out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Basic Stereo Support and local file support<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first step is to set up some basic audio support on your device.  If your device has an audio port already, you can skip adding a usb audio device.  Otherwise, plug in your usb audio-out and check that  your dmesg log shows it being recognized.  Every one I have tried is recognized without an issue, and I have tried dozens.  I am starting to think they are all pretty standardized.  Add a user to your system.  I know this seems off to many embedded folks but logging in as root is a bad idea for anything on the network.  Make sure your user is in the audio, cdrom, and dialout groups, as well as any admin groups you want them in.  Pull in some basic prerequisites for a networked audio system with <\/p>\n<p><code>apt-get install alsa alsa-utils apmd alsa-oss mpg123 libasound2-plugins git alsa-headers build-essential sudo<br \/>\nnfs-kernel-server nfs-common alsa-base alsaplayer alsaplayer-text alsa-utils libasound2 vlc<\/code><\/p>\n<p>This will pull in some basic media players and the alsa architecture.  If your USB audio is like mine, the levels will be off.  Edit a file called \/etc\/asound.conf, and paste <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/plainpcmfile.txt\">the attached text<\/a>  This will up the levels.  Reboot your system, then immediately open up alsamixer and drop the levels down to 80% each.  The right level will take a LOT of down arrow presses, so don&#8217;t think that it isn&#8217;t working.  It&#8217;s actually just going through a larger volume level that&#8217;s being scaled down to 100% by alsamixer.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Networked Digital Music<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve already got a NFS or Samba share set up on your network.  While there&#8217;s nothing abnormal about setting up NFS on an embedded system versus any other, if you&#8217;re uninitiated it&#8217;s a pretty esoteric process.  It basically boils down to setting up a client and a server.  We&#8217;ll want to run both on this system, as we&#8217;ll want to stream in NFS shares from across the network, and we&#8217;ll want to share whatever is plugged into this over the network.    To set up the client, we&#8217;ll simply add entries to our \/etc\/fstab in the following format.  <\/p>\n<p><code> IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER:\/share\/sharedir     \/localdir\/localsharedir   nfs     defaults        0      0<\/code><\/p>\n<p>To set up the server, we&#8217;ll simply add entries to our \/etc\/exports in the following format.<\/p>\n<p><code>\/srv\/nfs4\/homes  gss\/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)<\/code><\/p>\n<p>After a reboot, you should be sharing and seeing your shares from the network in your mounted locations.  Make sure you&#8217;ve created directories for the mounts beforehand, or they&#8217;ll fail during automount. <\/p>\n<p><strong>RSD Remote Audio Server<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vlcncurses1.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vlcncurses1-300x223.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"vlcncurses\" width=\"300\" height=\"223\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2277\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vlcncurses1-300x223.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vlcncurses1-402x300.png 402w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vlcncurses1.png 804w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>VLC comes with a nice ncurses interface you can use for testing audio playback.  Just execute <code>vlc -I ncurses<\/code> from any terminal and you&#8217;ll get the ncurses interface.  Shift-B gives you a nice file browser ala DOS.  At this point you should be able to SSH into your box and play audio files from the command line interface.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>VNC and Window Maker<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Command line interfaces are great, as are SSH terminals&#8230; but there&#8217;s a lot to be said for a nice graphical playlist manager.  VNC is a nice lightweight way to keep one of these playlist managers open, so we&#8217;ll go ahead and install that with <\/p>\n<p><code> sudo apt-get install tightvncserver xorg<\/code><\/p>\n<p>From here, give yourself a vnc password by executing <code>vncpasswd<\/code>  It&#8217;ll ask for a view-only password as well.  This is optional, but pretty handy for VJ-ing and screen sharing.  Now simply execute a vnc session for your user with <code>vncserver<\/code>.  <\/p>\n<p>Now on whatever box you&#8217;re going to VNC in from, install a VNC viewer.  If you&#8217;re using windows or another platform which supports java, I recommend the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tightvnc.com\/ssh-java-vnc-viewer.php\">new beta<\/a> of tightvnc+ssh (java).  It&#8217;s recent, has built-in ssh tunnelling (which improves both overhead and security), and is cross-platform.  Install your client, then connect to your arm box using the password you just created.  You&#8217;re going to see a plain X desktop with a single console.  I first recommend installing aptitude, as it&#8217;ll make finding new packages much easier visually.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vnc1.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vnc1-300x243.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"vnc\" width=\"300\" height=\"243\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2319\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vnc1-300x243.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vnc1-1024x832.png 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vnc1-369x300.png 369w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vnc1.png 1057w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Next I strongly recommend installing a better window manager.  <a href=\"http:\/\/windowmaker.org\/\">Window Maker<\/a> is quite good, and I haven&#8217;t featured it yet in a hack.

This isn&#8217;t such a huge deal, as many of us grew up with computers which had far less memory.  It does mean we have to keep an eye on our memory usage though.  For some unknown reason, I could not find conky in the debian arm repository.  Gnome-system-monitor is in there and works fine, but takes up a whopping 20% of the CPU when its generating graphs.  Not really acceptable.  So I set out to compile <a href=\"http:\/\/conky.sourceforge.net\/\">conky<\/a>.  If you like conky too, just<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a directory in which to compile conky, and change into that directory<\/li>\n<li>Init the directory with <code>git init<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Pull conky with <code>git clone git:\/\/git.omp.am\/conky.git<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Change to the subdirectory conky<\/li>\n<li>Create a directory called build, and change into that directory<\/li>\n<li>Install the prerequisites for conky with <code>sudo apt-get install cmake liblua5.1 liblua5.1-dev libx11-dev cmake-gui libpthread-stubs0-dev libfreetype6-dev libxft-dev gawk ncurses-dev libncurses-* xmms2 libxdamage-dev libxext-dev <\/code><\/li>\n<li>You could execute the cmake pre-build with <code>cmake ..\/<\/code>  , but I prefer to disable a ton of features I won&#8217;t need.  Just open up cmake-gui and point it at the conky directory.  Then disable almost everything.  I leave math, music players, xmms2, xdamage, freetype, and the x11 options checked.

I set out to see exactly how large a playlist I can add to Audacious (a lightweight xmms2\/beep-based media player) without filling up all the memory.  Unfortunately Audacious segfaults.  So I went about compiling <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/beepmp\/\">Beep<\/a> from source, just so I&#8217;d have it.  The following is therefore optional.  This had a few prerequisites, which were taken care of with a <code>sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-* xorg-dev xserver-xorg-dev sqlite3 libstartup-notification* libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglade2-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libneon27-dev libnotify-dev glibmm* gamin libgamin-dev libmusicbrainz4-dev libtaglib* libsqlite3-dev  libhal-storage-dev libhal-dev<br \/>\n<\/code>  Simply extract the Beep source file, execute the classic <code>.\/configure && make &&sudo make install<\/code> , and you&#8217;re good to go.  If it fails to compile, it&#8217;s because of a reference to an old PRIVATE_ variable in gtk.  Simply delete the offending line (103 in widgets\/bmp_tooltips.c).  You may also need to add <code>#include <cstdlib> <\/code> for any file which complains about memcpy not being defined, or <code>#include <cstring><\/code> for any file which complains about strlen.  After all that, and quite a bit of time for compilation and linking, everything should compile fine.

Select &#8220;directsound &#8211; rSound networked audio&#8221; as the output device.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/rsound1.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/rsound1-300x248.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"rsound\" width=\"300\" height=\"248\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2305\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/rsound1-300x248.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/rsound1-362x300.png 362w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/rsound1.png 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s that.

While I mentioned in the [last Dockstar Stereo article](http:\/\/hunterdavis.com\/archives\/2269) that you could run a video or Window Maker session over VNC, I never went into any details on the fun things you can do with VNC sessions. Read on for a couple of fun VNC tricks and tips that you may not have heard before. I assume you to be using a Linux installation.

Generally, people use this to start window managers or startup programs but it isn\u2019t really necessary. It\u2019s also a regular old shell script, that fully supports environment variables. For this reason we can comment out what we don\u2019t want in the script, and add an environment variable for the startup application. I recommend installing ratpoison (`sudo apt-get install ratpoison`) as it auto-maximizes single application sessions. Edit your .vnc\/xstartup so that it looks like the following: ```\n<br><\/br>\nxrdb $HOME\/.Xresources<br><\/br>\nxsetroot -solid grey<br><\/br>\n#x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title \"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop\" &<br><\/br>\n#x-window-manager &<br><\/br>\n# Fix to make GNOME work<br><\/br>\nexport XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1<br><\/br>\n#\/etc\/X11\/Xsession<br><\/br>\nratpoison &<br><\/br>\n$APP &<br><\/br>```\n\nNow whenever you start a vncserver session, you\u2019ll preface it with the name of the app. For instance, `export APP=banshee;vncserver ` will open a vncserver session with banshee as the only running item. This could be a full window manager such as window maker, but it could also be a single application session such as banshee or ssh. Below are some fun screenshots that may give you some fun ideas. You can set up a view-only password and do some viewcasting, or maybe do some collaborative document or playlist editing.

Nowadays when most of us tech savvy folk connect to a VNC server we do so over an SSH session (even on my android phone). As such, in the background we\u2019re actually logging into an ssh session on the host computer, tunneling the VNC port to our local machine, and connecting to that. As such, we\u2019re actually authenticating twice. Once through SSH, and once through VNC. We can eliminate one of these authentication measures if we choose (blank passwords on VNC sessions, duplicate passwords for VNC and authentication, etc), but I\u2019ll leave you to debate the merit of that security move. Rather, we\u2019re going to take advantage of some of the built-in features that come with user authentication (like the security model). Users are placed into groups which restrict access to certain subsystems (i.e. audio, cdrom, network, dialout, superuser, etc). By modeling users after the functions they are allowed to perform (like smurfs), we can do some really fun things and ironically allow for a more \u201copen\u201d environment. Where could this come in handy? Imagine these scenarios:\n\n- You\u2019re running a coffee shop. You\u2019ve got an embedded linux box doing double duty as the cafe firewall and the digital jukebox in the back, and you\u2019d like to let your baristas queue up new music or let your customers view the currently playing track.\n- You\u2019re having a lan party. You\u2019d like a simple leaderboard to be visible by all on any devices, but editable by the admins. You don\u2019t know HTML, and have never set up apache.\n- You don\u2019t know how to program at all, but you\u2019d like to host a VJ party for your friends.\n- You have a merchant shop, with rotating displays you\u2019d like to be displayed on all terminals, and you hate powerpoint\n- You run a programming lab, and you\u2019d like to easily try pair programming.\n- You have 15 Linux boxes scattered throughout the world recording data. You want to be able to remotely administer them, while allowing your assistant to remotely view your progress\n- You\u2019re a hard-boiled FBI agent tracking down a hacker and serial killer who is on the loose. You want to set up a honeypot to give him false information, and you need an enticing target for your hacker to be able to \u201clook over your shoulder\u201d as it were.\n\nLuckily for all of us each of these scenarios can be easily resolved with the same simple set of steps, and a liberal application of VNC. Let\u2019s add a user Jukebox whose sole purpose in life is to play music.\n\n1. Add the user jukebox with `sudo adduser jukebox`\n2. This will prompt you for a password and username, set these according to your security preferences\n3. Add the user jukebox to the bin, audio, and ssh groups with ` usermod -a -G bin jukebox && usermod -a -G audio jukebox && usermod -a -G ssh jukebox`\n4. Log in as this user with `su jukebox`, then set a vncpassword for this user with `vncpasswd`\n5. This will prompt you to set a vnc password, and a vnc view-only password.\n6. Test that a basic vnc session works with `vncserver`\n7. Edit your ~\/.vnc\/xstartup to contain only the program you wish this user to run as we did above.\n8. Add vncserver to the user\u2019s .profile (so it starts when we ssh in) with `echo vncserver >> ~\/.profile`\n\nAnd that\u2019s that. Each of the scenarios above is just a customization of the security settings for the above steps. For instance in the coffee shop example above you could have the manager ssh into the jukebox when it first loads to start up a VNC session, then have the baristas connect using the normal VNC password and the customers connect using the view-only password.\n\n[![](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vnssesh1-300x176.png \"vnssesh\")](http:\/\/66.147.244.180\/~hunterda\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/vnssesh1.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>While it will be a bit before my next full update in the&#8221;Using the Dockstar as a full Home Theater Replacement&#8221; series (conveniently shortened to Dockstar Stereo), I&#8217;m always tweaking and installing things.

On a whim I picked up a little tv to use as a monitor for the Dockstar stereo, and I hooked the Wii up to it to see how things were going in the Wii homebrew community. I was BLOWN away. Not only has the wii media center grown tremendously, (it streams from samba shares), all the emulators have been updated (ps1 games from samba shares!), and there\u2019s a tremendously dynamic game modification community (check out smashmods for some of the coolest in-ram game modification you will EVER see). The wii VNC client works quite well as a head unit for the dockstar stereo, but it\u2019s got a native MPD frontend that I thought would be fun to get running.

After that finishes installing, edit the system wide configuration with `sudo vim \/etc\/mpd.conf` and change the settings to your liking. Specifically,\n\n1. Un-comment the two zeroconf_ lines to be enabled if you wish to have zeroconf\/avahi support (nice)\n2. Change the music_directory to point to your actual music directory\n3. Uncomment the mixer_type = software line\n4. I like to have MPD settings stored under \/user\/mpd, so change all references to \/var\/mpd to \/usr\/mpd and create a \/usr\/mpd directory that is user readable with `sudo mkdir \/usr\/mpd && sudo chmod 777 \/usr\/mpd`\n\nNow save this file, and then restart MPD with:  \n`sudo \/etc\/init.d\/mpd restart`\n\nThis will also restart the database creation process if you've changed the location in the configuration as I did above. It'll take a while for the database creation to finish, I recommend throwing up a top screen and checking it every once in a while. You can load up Sonata in a VNC session (or wiiVNC if you like) and get some playlists made, start a playlist playing, play tracks, etc.\n\n**Using WiiMPC**\n\nInstall WiiMPC as you would any other homebrew app (homebrew channel, homebrew launcher, etc). Ftp over to your wii (or pop out the SD card and insert it into your computer) and edit a new file called `\/YOURWIISDCARDROOT\/apps\/wiimpc\/wiimpc.conf`  \n Enter into this file a single line containing your MPD server address like:  \n`MPD_HOST = 192.168.0.161`\n\nNow load up wiiMPC in your wii and you should be connected to your Dockstar Stereo and ready to play some music \ud83d\ude42\n\n\n","html":"<p>Chris Irwin alerted me in a previous article about MPD, the music playing daemon.

the old FAQ:\n\n<div id=\"inner\"><div>Q: What is QuickGrapher?  \n A: QuickGrapher is an equation parser and solver which supports graphing functions that your old calculator never could. You can use it to easily graph equations, balance your budget, make embeddable graphs for your website, blog post, or social networking site, and so much more.Q: How do I start using QuickGrapher?  \n A: QuickGrapher comes with a number of built-in example equations to get you started. Simply click on one of the example equations to begin editing it or enter your own equation into the equation box and click \u201cGraph!\u201d. There are also helpful video walkthroughs below.Q: Are my equations private?  \n A: Yes. Unlike Wolfram Alpha, Google, or most other web-based equation utilities, our custom analytical math and graphing libraries run completely in the browser. Your equations are never sent to a server and do not require an internet connection or installed software. We allow you to update graphs in real-time without using your precious internet bandwidth.Q: What browsers support QuickGrapher?  \n A: Any browser which supports HTML5 is sufficient to run QuickGrapher. No flash or third party plugins are required. The newest versions of Chrome, Opera, and Safari have built-in support for HTML5, as do the newest beta versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer.  \n Q: Do I need any installed software or plugins to run QuickGrapher?  \n A: No, QuickGrapher is built from the ground up to run directly in the browser. No installed software or third party plugins are necessary. You do not need Flash, Shockwave, or any other plugin. Quickgrapher is a pure Javascript and HTML5 application, technologies which are built into modern browsers.<\/div><\/div><div><\/div><div><\/div>\n","html":"<p>QuickGrapher.com was one of the research projects spun out of Discursive Labs. \u00a0 One of the most promising projects we worked on, it always felt like a project without an intended audience, and it never really lifted off. \u00a0I&#8217;m quite proud of the work that Mark and I did, and think it&#8217;s a tremendously cool project.<\/p>\n<p>You can use it to embed graphs of any equation within a webpage as easily as a single tag. \u00a0You can use it to solve complex equations, functions, etc. \u00a0It runs completely in client side Javascript and doesn&#8217;t require a web connection. it runs on mobile and desktop platforms. \u00a0It can display hundreds of thousands of data points and adjust them in real-time. \u00a0And now it&#8217;s open source, BSD licensed, and ready for you to use to escape the tyrannical grasp of Wolfram Alpha.<\/p>\n<p>You can see an outdated version of it in action\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/quickgrapher\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Download, exploit, and contribute to the source at the github project\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/Quick-Grapher\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Find out how to embed QuickGrapher on your site <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/popular-open-source-projects\/quickgrapher_open_source\/adding-embedded-quick-grapher-to-your-site\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Videos:<br \/>\n<iframe width=\"700\" height=\"525\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WOC_IzFQt44?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><br \/>\n<iframe width=\"700\" height=\"525\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XiIPsVVtCU4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><br \/>\n<iframe width=\"700\" height=\"525\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ej7pAX2fMj4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><br \/>\n<iframe width=\"700\" height=\"525\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/o24ph-0_u9M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Check out the drake equation in QuickGrapher\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/quickgrapher\/index.html?StarFormationRate*StarsWithPlanets*LifeSustainingPlanets*PlanetsWhichActuallyDevelopLife*PlanetsWithIntelligentLife*CivilizationsWithDetectors*DurationOfSpaceSignals=0:0:0:0:0:0:0:{20:1:10:1:1:1:20:}1:0.1:1:0.1:0.1:0.1:1:[10:0.5:2:1:0.1:0.1:10:;1:1:1:1:1:1:1:=Drake%20Equation]\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the old FAQ:<\/p>\n<div id=\"inner\">\n<div>Q: What is QuickGrapher?<br \/>\nA: QuickGrapher is an equation parser and solver which supports graphing functions that your old calculator never could.

\u00a0It gets better. \u00a0My ancient pre-hunterdavis.com website from 2001 is still available on the wayback machine! \u00a0I\u2019ve posted all my rants from 2001 below the break.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/tenyearsofhd.gif \"tenyearsofhd\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/tenyearsofhd.gif)\n\n10.\/14\/2001\n\nI\u2019m putting up my christmas lists today.\n\n10\/13\/2001\n\nWell it\u2019s been a while. I\u2019ve got some good news and some bad news. Well ok no bad news as enterprise is on tonight and it takes names. The good news is I can get my opengl stuff to compile and run under windows so maybe i\u2019ll throw down some csserver adventure graphical adventure pretty soon. we\u2019ll have to see.\n\n9\/22\/2001\n\nSorry for the frequent dropouts in ping time and connections, the cable modem\u2019s been acting up on me. Everything should be ok for the rest of the weekend though.\n\nFor those of you who can\u2019t get to it, i put up the wolfie multiplayer test to download *\/this is no longer the case*\/\n\n9\/18\/2001\n\nMy new switch has come in!!! Csserver Adventure is back online! I\u2019ll be posting examples for cs355 graphics in the next day or two, expect chapter 2 examples that work and hopefully a canvas class that will properly compile with a special myGLprog.cc made all special like. I\u2019ll also be posting pictures from my big vacation soon, and a help guide\/tutorial to start out cs355.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCsserver Comic! will probably not continue due to lack of interest, i might start it up again someday though, after my movie gets made this summer.\n\n8\/9\/2001\n\n**Update 2**\n\nWell I have put up quite a list of previously banned texts. That fact that some of them have been banned in the past is a tribute to censorship. Honestly, high school barring Huck Finn? I have about 30 works up so far, all of Sherlock Holmes stuff, some other interesting stuff and i\u2019ll be putting up the complete works (possibly just the plays) of Shakespeare and the complete works of edgar allen poe. I\u2019ll be going through most of my world cultures books and putting those up (or at least the ones that are legal to put up [us copyright law])\n\n**Update: As long as i\u2019m going to be a document server i\u2019m going to start puttin up previously banned texts that we generally have to read for a university class, the ones that cost bucks and you use once. I hope i can save someone some money**\n\nI have been asked to host the Anarchist Cookbook on my web server. Having researched the legal implications of this i have procured a publicly available copycat version of the book so i\u2019m going to put it up under the archives\/documents section. If anyone really wants to look you can find a few other versions around the web and you can even buy the original on amazon for 7 dollars. I\u2019m all for the first amendment so have at it. Just don\u2019t try anything that\u2019s on it.\n\n8\/04\/2001\n\n**Update** Scanner is gone, returned it after period of inactivity. Site was down for about an hour due to blackout but is back up***\n\n7a.m. And my neighbor\u2019s having a yard sale. How exciing is that? I got the scanner, comic 2 is up. I just took some pain medication so i\u2019m floating in a sea of drug induced tranquility for the time being. Perhaps i\u2019ll have another comic up for you today? Maybe i\u2019ll work on more enemies in my game? Maybe i\u2019ll just sit here and watch the pretty colors swirl by my face. Time will tell i guess.\n\n8\/03\/2001\n\n**Update: I bought a scanner today. Csserver Comic ## 2 is up, and the suspense is building\u2026**\n\nBill Splitter Calculator is up and running, basically it\u2019s for multiple people splitting a bill. Sounds simple enought right? Basically it is, but there\u2019s a bit more too it than that. My problem is that whenever i get a new roommate it\u2019s in the middle of the month and it takes a little while to figure out the costs that everyone should pay. Well that\u2019s basically what this little javascript program does, it lets you enter in the number of days each person was available for the time period of the bill and the calculator figures out how much each person (up to 5) owes on that bill.\n\nIn other news, i still havn\u2019t gotten a scanner, so ther\u2019es no csserver comic number 2 yet, but worry not i\u2019ll buy one as soon as i get one cheap enough. I\u2019m still laid out in bed for another couple weeks (surgery) so expect a lot of new programs and updates in the next few (basically so i don\u2019t go nuts with boredom.) I\u2019m thinking of putting my web cam back up, but that\u2019s always a tough decision considering how often i comb my hair. Maybe i\u2019ll get a hair cut today\u2026 maybe.\n\n8\/2\/2001 **Update** Online Bill Splitter Calculator will be going up today!\n\nAfter an extensive surgery what do you normally do?? It turns out that I get really bored and start programming. I have updated csserver adventure to beta 1.5. Basically I have ironed out all the bugs and added a few other perks (mult-name characters, ect\u2026) I\u2019ll be adding an account for playing the game only on my box so clicking on the Play Csserver Adventure Online Link will now also give you a username and password to play the game with. It should also work on mobile phones and java devices but i have not tested it as of yet.\n\nUpdates for the month of July\u2013  \n Csserver Adventure (The Comic) Episode 1 is up!  \n Update # 2: I have signed up for a messageboard that a few people have told me is pretty good, i guess we\u2019ll see if anyone posts. I\u2019m starting work on the comic, i\u2019ll probably get a scanner in the next week.\n\nUpdate: I am looking into doing a web-comic for csserver adventure, and cs life here in general. I\u2019m going to have to scan in some pictures of people and things so i\u2019m going to have to buy a scanner first. If anyone knows a win2k (i use photoshop, sorry i\u2019m i windows pansy in that respect) compatible scanner around here for around 30 bucks, give me a holler. I already have some storylines drawn up, should be able to post pretty often whenever i get the scanner.\n\nThis is now being hosted by ME! mwahahahaa. My linux box is now fully operational and soon you will see the power of this death-star!!!! I also am bringing my old site over here so you\u2019ll soon have a link to that on the navigation bar.\n\nNew Beginings, new Languages, and a new life  \n 6-23-2001\u2013 Here it is, the long awaited post from our dead, forgotten here of the page\u2026 Time to tie up some loose ends. Half.com is once again honorable, and then some. I was refunded a generous amount for thier mistake in letting the burner sell me a game, and I was very happy when i saw my account statement. I never got any money from the guy in Florida for my magic cards, and I know now that i never will. Was it fate telling me to hold on to my cards? Nope, it was fate calling me a loser for letting a bunch of money go down the toilet. All my friends have already abandoned magic, a testament to the inability of life-dominating factors to hold our interest for more than a few years. Now I am left with this magic collection that I cannot sell for 1\/10 it\u2019s worth, and don\u2019t know where I would do it anyway. Maybe one of these days i\u2019ll stop by a comic shop and see if i can get some videogames or anime\/manga out of it on a trade, but the future does not look bright for my magic cards. I have learned my lesson, Ebay, half.dot.com., etc may be fine to sell things, but it\u2019s too easy to get ripped off by an online store. I am about to buy the new Ura Zelda games, you know, the ones for game-boy. Everything I\u2019ve heard sounds good, but first I\u2019ve gotta get circle of the moon (castlevania) I\u2019m building a new system. 2 actually, one for my little sis who\u2019s leaving for college across town next week and one for, well hell what reason do nerds ever give for wanting a second system, it\u2019s gonna be sweet. I found this old 386 rackmount server with an lcd display and keylock, just like back in the day. I painted the sides black and the top and back silver. The front is really dark blue. The front and sides have silver paint lightly sprayed in a fine mist over them to give the appearance of a night sky that\u2019s cloudy and full of stars. This system is going to take more names than any system has ever taken before. I\u2019ll probably end up putting one of those new mobos in where it has a geforce2mx built right in, that should hopefully save me some bread. Maybe i\u2019ll buy an actual thunderbird instead of overclocking my duron again\u2026maybe. Either way i\u2019m going to have to get a huge hard drive for it, it\u2019s going to get my new video capture card (quality not like the tvwondervePOS that i\u2019ve been struggling with, i\u2019m giving it to my sister) When in doubt, buy something new. i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an actual saying but it sums up all i feel about the computer industry at this very moment in an all-consuming cracker with cheese on it kind of statement. Kick ass. Penny-Arcade is kicking ass as usual, but they\u2019re feeling the industry-wide belt tightening just like the rest of us. We all wish we could donate more to em, but that\u2019s just not the way life\u2019s goin down right now. I hope i can convince my friends to go to necrowombiecon it will be the greatest get-together of nerd-types ever!! In light of that, i am going to have to start saving some money up right now, especially with my tonsils coming out next week and me being unable to work for 2 weeks because of that fact. Hopefulliy i\u2019ll be able to take the greyhound up to chicago during that time to see my sugar momma. On that note, i\u2019m off to watch the crouching tiger dvd again, later  \n Sega Dreamcast Emulation and the end of honor  \n 3\/13\/2001\u2013 Well my moral dilemma is over. Like so many other \u201cburning plants\u201d the guy who sold me the burned dreamcast game has been shut down. I had nothing to do with it. Good for me I suppose, justice prevailed in the end I suppose, but I still don\u2019t have my cash back. I emailed half dot com, and hopefully they will return the money I spent and I\u2019ll buy a real game this time. hopefully.  \n Now, on to the good stuff. The dreamcast is a powerful system, a powerful system that can emulate other systems. Once again, it\u2019s not legal to emulate games you do not own, but playing through some of my old favorites has been great! Super nes, gameboy, genesis, master system, even some computer games (and linux) can be emulated. Check out dcemulation for some great info about it. I have personally caused the decline of my roommates study habits thanks to the original Shining Force. He\u2019ll never be the same again. I sent away all my applications today to major game companies, hopefully I\u2019ll get a call back soon, hopefully. The production of morse-games is going painfully slow, I\u2019ll be lucky to finish any of them before next year. But they will be finished!!! It\u2019s a real shame about the demise of the Dreamcast, I seriously doubt this phoenix will rise again. That\u2019s a sad sad moment in game history in my opinion, the demise of sega systems. Nintendo and later Sony have always dominated, but there has always been sega in the background, plugging away with good RPGs and such, but no longer. Even if they begin to make games for other systems, will they ever have the glory of having their own system again? I have a theory about that. Microsoft will need a developer for it\u2019s X-box, and sega is experienced in that area at least. But what about the ever-increasing handheld market. A handheld Win-CE game console will not be far off, but who has the manufacturing capability and market know-how to make it fly, and who has worked with Microsoft in the past??? SEGA! That\u2019s right I see Sega of America turning it\u2019s back on console manufacturing completely, and focusing on the handheld market (a market that it had always worked in but never excelled, I have a theory about that too**) Hopefully some of our favorite sega characters will continue to live on, but if not, oh well, I\u2019ve always got my dreamcast and my dreams.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Ok, here it is. Sega was one of the original portable console game manufactures, what went wrong? First of all, the hardware sucked. The screen may have been brilliant, but the technology required 6 AA batteries every 3 hours!! That\u2019s freakin crazy! Next, it based it\u2019s compatibility on a system that nobody had bought (master system) seriously, how many people did you know with a master system? Not many I\u2019m sure. With the overpriced unit floating on store shelves, the market was ripe for the gameboy to excel. With 2 A batteries lasting over 6 hours and a slew of games with familiar characters and themes, the gameboy dominated, and still dominates 12 years later!! You can still play 12 year old games on your new color game boy systems (and soon on your gameboy advance systems) Now that\u2019s longevity, based on the broken back of Sega.\n\nSega Dreamcast, honor, and burned games  \n 3\/9\/2001\u2013 OK, I understand that many of you like to use burned games, but none of you (I hope) have any delusions about their legality, they are illegal. That said, I am not condoning the use of the games, but I am not about to make a judgment call there so lets continue. Well, we\u2019ve all heard of half.com right? Get movies and games half price. Why are the games so cheap? BECAUSE MANY OF THEM ARE BURNED! Listen to me or learn this the hard way. I ordered a dreamcast game (a capcom vs. title) thinking I was getting a good deal for a 20 spot\u2026 Yeah right! It comes in the mail, and guess what\u2026it\u2019s burned! What a load of crap, it\u2019s not even guaranteed to work at all. To make it worse, the guy sends me a gameshark cd \u201cfree\u201d so that the deal will seem sweeter. Lets see\u2026.WHY HEY, LOOKIE HERE, IT\u2019S BURNED!! Trying to remain calm I think it over, I just paid 20 freaking dollars for 60 cents worth of burned disks!!!!! Argh ahhhh, to quote scorpion* circa 1992, if thoughts could kill 50% of the world\u2019s population would\u2019ve just dropped dead. If I wanted a janked up crack and a burned cd i would\u2019ve made it myself. The worst of it is I can\u2019t get my cash back, that\u2019s right I\u2019m forced to spend more money or break the law. Whether or not the disk works is not the point, I\u2019m just pissed I was forced into it. Even worse, I\u2019m forced into another ethical dillema, should I write the guy asking for my money back, should I rat him out, a cardinal sin among gamers? Of course I\u2019m not going to rat his ass out, but with me getting screwed over a lot lately I\u2019ve been getting a little pissed at the way things have been going. Oh, and the guy\u2019s not a guy, he\u2019s a regular corporation. So he\u2019s ripping off a ton of people this way. A regular street husler-type. I can\u2019t exactly force him to email people that his games are burned either, to bring in some kind of authority breaks the code. I guess it\u2019s another polite letter time. Hooray.  \n *For those of you who who lived under an adventure gaming rock back in the day, scorpion was an unnamed game review\/strategy writer in the early days of computer gaming world.\n\nGame Ending Mechanics  \n 2\/28\/2001\u2013 I know what you\u2019re thinking, why does this engineer seem so obsessed with the ending to the ocarina of time? Or at least that\u2019s what you would be thinking if you could see me right now. Let me clue you in, I just witnessed one of the most graphically superb endings ever. By the same note it tied up most storyline problems and cut a few loose ends. So why was it so unfulfilling? In a word, content. The Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of time was a great game by most standards. The graphics, storyline, and game-play were for the most part top notch. For a children\u2019s game. Therein lies the real problem, Zelda\u2019s target audience was a group of 10 year olds, cheat books in hand. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I did play Zelda when I was 10, and I have used a cheat book or 2 in my day, but why does the game have to tailor to the lowest common denominator. Honestly, when you watch a movie, and it is rated pg-13, does that mean that it should only have the intellectual maturity to match a typical 13 year old? Of course not! Coming from one who has played more than my fair share of games in my lifetime (well games kind of have been my lifetime if you know where I\u2019m coming from) I can tell you that this was not always the case. Final Fantasy 2 (IV in Jap.) was, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest games ever made. I played through it over and over. Was it the game mechanics? Not really, the game could easily have been made on a NES and the controls could have been improved. It was the storyline. And moreover, it was the way that Square did not cheap out at any end-point in the game. I define an end-point as any point where a significant aspect of game-play ends or a character is lost from play. In FF2 this could easily be defiened at a number of points, my favorite being the death of Sage Tellah. (anyone who played it should take note of the beauty of game mechanics intertwined with story *- continued later) HE DIED! Better yet, he didn\u2019t crap out and die, he died in a way consistent to the story and gameplay. And they explained it! Not to say that a game should hold your hand storyline-wise, by any means, all I\u2019m asking is that a storyline aspect be clear, and not left incredibly void, intended to spark a sequel. The ending of Zelda was fine, except for one small point (*SPOILER) Zelda and Link never hook up, and you don\u2019t know how much of the future they remember! (this may seem terribly confusing to someone who has not played the game so I implore you people, play it) I am not arguing for more romance, or even more drama, only a bit more clarity in the ending. If an ending is meant to end a game and not begin a sequel (Back-to-the-Future syndrome) then shouldn\u2019t a player feel rewarded or at least somewhat relieved in his victory. Shouldn\u2019t a player be rewarded? The fact of the matter is that the ending of the Legend of Zelda was not a failure because of a coding mistake, or a storyline mistake, it was a failure because of a marketing mistake. Nintendo left the ending purposefully vague so that it could create a sequel with minimum storyline-hassle. With all the loose ends flying around, who needs actual writers, lets just pick up an end and write another paragraph\u2026  \n *Sage Tellah Game Mechanics\u2013 As mentioned before, the beauty of the Sage Tellah storyline was both it\u2019s ending and it\u2019s mechanics. The ending was poetic and powerful, it left a lasting impression on the rest of the game and was an excellent plot continuation device. (Edge\u2019s parents\u2019 deaths and the fight vs. Rubicant was another such point) However, the real beauty lie in the mechanics of Tellah\u2019s death. All throughout the game Tellah has been searching for the Ultimate Magic \u2014 meteo. When he finally learns it you are unable to have him cast it, why? Because the mechanics of the Tellah character did not allow his magic points to go above 98, and the meteo spell cost 99 magic points. Clever eh? No extra programming was needed, just a simple magic-point cap. So when Tellah does cast meteo in a fit of rage and justice, it kills him. Poetically simple, and just as sweet. An excellent game and if you don\u2019t own it I highly recommend finding a copy. (Or just buy the game, then download the emulator, that way everything is nice and legal.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnline Ordering, Magic Cards, and About getting Ripped off\u2026  \n 2\/26\/2001\u2013 Well, another Monday went buy without too much hassle. Had a fairly tough logic and design test, and I really should work on my Combinatorics homework, but those of you who know me should know better. I\u2019m still waiting on my dreamcast and games, I have high hopes for the system, even if it commercially failed. Tomorrow I go in to the career office to try to find a job in the game industry. I hope I hope I hope. I sent away some of my old magic cards about a month ago, to this place in Florida, and have yet to receive payment. I know that things happen, but this is a bit distressing. It\u2019s been about 10 days since his last email where he apologized for not having sent the money earlier. I sent a partial-threatening letter yesterday, and hope that I will get my check soon. There\u2019s the real sad part, the money. I was not desperate for the cash, but think of some kid who sent away his magic collection in hopes of getting some new cards (or a dreamcast, or heck, a computer (imagine that ;)) I\u2019ve lost a lot of respect for the gaming industry, but who knows, maybe, just maybe I\u2019ll get that 80 bucks and feel better. Ya know what\u2019s really strange? Directx programming has a direct correlation to the topics we\u2019re covering in object oriented programming right now, strange huh? Who would\u2019ve thought a course at this school would pan out\u2026  \n Just another lazy Sunday\u2026  \n 2\/25\/2001\u2013 Well, it\u2019s Sunday again and there is much studying to do\u2026 Yeah right. Anxiously awaiting the arrival of my new dreamcast game I sit around on our new couch, bored. I updated the site with some archived programs from last year, I haven\u2019t been motivated enough to compile them in Windows or add graphics so they\u2019re plain old unix style command line programs. I can\u2019t wait till my new programming book comes in next week, My goal is to program Pac-Morse my the end of spring break. Let me clue you guys in, Dr Morse is my academic advisor and object-oriented teacher. I like the guy, but sometimes we students feel like little pellets being gobbled up, like in a Pac-man game. Well, I ordered a new book on graphs and game programming in C++ so I\u2019m making Pac-Morse my first goal. Tomorrow I go down to apply at various game companies with my career counselor, wish me luck\u2026  \n Beginnings\u2026.  \n 2\/23\/01\u2013Well, here I am, programming a web site to showcase my programs, and I only have 1 program I want to put up. Typical, computer programmers seem to be the perfectionist type, until it\u2019s time to turn in a program for class. Therein lies the rub, for the more anal retentive the programmer, the more errors he will choose to ignore in a program forced upon him by his school or institution.

That fact that some of them have been banned in the past is a tribute to censorship. Honestly, high school barring Huck Finn? I have about 30 works up so far, all of Sherlock Holmes stuff, some other interesting stuff and i&#8217;ll be putting up the complete works (possibly just the plays) of Shakespeare and the complete works of edgar allen poe.

Having researched the legal implications of this i have procured a publicly available copycat version of the book so i&#8217;m going to put it up under the archives\/documents section. If anyone really wants to look you can find a few other versions around the web and you can even buy the original on amazon for 7 dollars. I&#8217;m all for the first amendment so have at it.

I just took some pain medication so i&#8217;m floating in a sea of drug induced tranquility for the time being. Perhaps i&#8217;ll have another comic up for you today? Maybe i&#8217;ll work on more enemies in my game? Maybe i&#8217;ll just sit here and watch the pretty colors swirl by my face.

Csserver Comic ## 2 is up, and the suspense is building&#8230;**<\/p>\n<p>Bill Splitter Calculator is up and running, basically it&#8217;s for multiple people splitting a bill. Sounds simple enought right? Basically it is, but there&#8217;s a bit more too it than that. My problem is that whenever i get a new roommate it&#8217;s in the middle of the month and it takes a little while to figure out the costs that everyone should pay. Well that&#8217;s basically what this little javascript program does, it lets you enter in the number of days each person was available for the time period of the bill and the calculator figures out how much each person (up to 5) owes on that bill.<\/p>\n<p>In other news, i still havn&#8217;t gotten a scanner, so ther&#8217;es no csserver comic number 2 yet, but worry not i&#8217;ll buy one as soon as i get one cheap enough. I&#8217;m still laid out in bed for another couple weeks (surgery) so expect a lot of new programs and updates in the next few (basically so i don&#8217;t go nuts with boredom.) I&#8217;m thinking of putting my web cam back up, but that&#8217;s always a tough decision considering how often i comb my hair. Maybe i&#8217;ll get a hair cut today&#8230; maybe.<\/p>\n<p>8\/2\/2001 **Update** Online Bill Splitter Calculator will be going up today!<\/p>\n<p>After an extensive surgery what do you normally do?? It turns out that I get really bored and start programming. I have updated csserver adventure to beta 1.5. Basically I have ironed out all the bugs and added a few other perks (mult-name characters, ect&#8230;) I&#8217;ll be adding an account for playing the game only on my box so clicking on the Play Csserver Adventure Online Link will now also give you a username and password to play the game with. It should also work on mobile phones and java devices but i have not tested it as of yet.<\/p>\n<p>Updates for the month of July&#8211;<br \/>\nCsserver Adventure (The Comic) Episode 1 is up!<br \/>\nUpdate # 2: I have signed up for a messageboard that a few people have told me is pretty good, i guess we&#8217;ll see if anyone posts.

I&#8217;m going to have to scan in some pictures of people and things so i&#8217;m going to have to buy a scanner first. If anyone knows a win2k (i use photoshop, sorry i&#8217;m i windows pansy in that respect) compatible scanner around here for around 30 bucks, give me a holler. I already have some storylines drawn up, should be able to post pretty often whenever i get the scanner.<\/p>\n<p>This is now being hosted by ME! mwahahahaa. My linux box is now fully operational and soon you will see the power of this death-star!!!! I also am bringing my old site over here so you&#8217;ll soon have a link to that on the navigation bar.<\/p>\n<p>New Beginings, new Languages, and a new life<br \/>\n6-23-2001&#8211; Here it is, the long awaited post from our dead, forgotten here of the page&#8230; Time to tie up some loose ends. Half.com is once again honorable, and then some. I was refunded a generous amount for thier mistake in letting the burner sell me a game, and I was very happy when i saw my account statement. I never got any money from the guy in Florida for my magic cards, and I know now that i never will. Was it fate telling me to hold on to my cards? Nope, it was fate calling me a loser for letting a bunch of money go down the toilet. All my friends have already abandoned magic, a testament to the inability of life-dominating factors to hold our interest for more than a few years. Now I am left with this magic collection that I cannot sell for 1\/10 it&#8217;s worth, and don&#8217;t know where I would do it anyway. Maybe one of these days i&#8217;ll stop by a comic shop and see if i can get some videogames or anime\/manga out of it on a trade, but the future does not look bright for my magic cards. I have learned my lesson, Ebay, half.dot.com., etc may be fine to sell things, but it&#8217;s too easy to get ripped off by an online store. I am about to buy the new Ura Zelda games, you know, the ones for game-boy. Everything I&#8217;ve heard sounds good, but first I&#8217;ve gotta get circle of the moon (castlevania) I&#8217;m building a new system. 2 actually, one for my little sis who&#8217;s leaving for college across town next week and one for, well hell what reason do nerds ever give for wanting a second system, it&#8217;s gonna be sweet. I found this old 386 rackmount server with an lcd display and keylock, just like back in the day. I painted the sides black and the top and back silver. The front is really dark blue. The front and sides have silver paint lightly sprayed in a fine mist over them to give the appearance of a night sky that&#8217;s cloudy and full of stars. This system is going to take more names than any system has ever taken before. I&#8217;ll probably end up putting one of those new mobos in where it has a geforce2mx built right in, that should hopefully save me some bread. Maybe i&#8217;ll buy an actual thunderbird instead of overclocking my duron again&#8230;maybe. Either way i&#8217;m going to have to get a huge hard drive for it, it&#8217;s going to get my new video capture card (quality not like the tvwondervePOS that i&#8217;ve been struggling with, i&#8217;m giving it to my sister) When in doubt, buy something new. i don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s an actual saying but it sums up all i feel about the computer industry at this very moment in an all-consuming cracker with cheese on it kind of statement. Kick ass. Penny-Arcade is kicking ass as usual, but they&#8217;re feeling the industry-wide belt tightening just like the rest of us. We all wish we could donate more to em, but that&#8217;s just not the way life&#8217;s goin down right now. I hope i can convince my friends to go to necrowombiecon it will be the greatest get-together of nerd-types ever!! In light of that, i am going to have to start saving some money up right now, especially with my tonsils coming out next week and me being unable to work for 2 weeks because of that fact. Hopefulliy i&#8217;ll be able to take the greyhound up to chicago during that time to see my sugar momma. On that note, i&#8217;m off to watch the crouching tiger dvd again, later<br \/>\nSega Dreamcast Emulation and the end of honor<br \/>\n3\/13\/2001&#8211; Well my moral dilemma is over. Like so many other &#8220;burning plants&#8221; the guy who sold me the burned dreamcast game has been shut down. I had nothing to do with it. Good for me I suppose, justice prevailed in the end I suppose, but I still don&#8217;t have my cash back. I emailed half dot com, and hopefully they will return the money I spent and I&#8217;ll buy a real game this time. hopefully.<br \/>\nNow, on to the good stuff. The dreamcast is a powerful system, a powerful system that can emulate other systems. Once again, it&#8217;s not legal to emulate games you do not own, but playing through some of my old favorites has been great! Super nes, gameboy, genesis, master system, even some computer games (and linux) can be emulated. Check out dcemulation for some great info about it. I have personally caused the decline of my roommates study habits thanks to the original Shining Force. He&#8217;ll never be the same again. I sent away all my applications today to major game companies, hopefully I&#8217;ll get a call back soon, hopefully. The production of morse-games is going painfully slow, I&#8217;ll be lucky to finish any of them before next year. But they will be finished!!! It&#8217;s a real shame about the demise of the Dreamcast, I seriously doubt this phoenix will rise again. That&#8217;s a sad sad moment in game history in my opinion, the demise of sega systems. Nintendo and later Sony have always dominated, but there has always been sega in the background, plugging away with good RPGs and such, but no longer. Even if they begin to make games for other systems, will they ever have the glory of having their own system again? I have a theory about that. Microsoft will need a developer for it&#8217;s X-box, and sega is experienced in that area at least. But what about the ever-increasing handheld market. A handheld Win-CE game console will not be far off, but who has the manufacturing capability and market know-how to make it fly, and who has worked with Microsoft in the past??? SEGA! That&#8217;s right I see Sega of America turning it&#8217;s back on console manufacturing completely, and focusing on the handheld market (a market that it had always worked in but never excelled, I have a theory about that too**) Hopefully some of our favorite sega characters will continue to live on, but if not, oh well, I&#8217;ve always got my dreamcast and my dreams.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>**Ok, here it is. Sega was one of the original portable console game manufactures, what went wrong? First of all, the hardware sucked. The screen may have been brilliant, but the technology required 6 AA batteries every 3 hours!! That&#8217;s freakin crazy! Next, it based it&#8217;s compatibility on a system that nobody had bought (master system) seriously, how many people did you know with a master system? Not many I&#8217;m sure. With the overpriced unit floating on store shelves, the market was ripe for the gameboy to excel. With 2 A batteries lasting over 6 hours and a slew of games with familiar characters and themes, the gameboy dominated, and still dominates 12 years later!! You can still play 12 year old games on your new color game boy systems (and soon on your gameboy advance systems) Now that&#8217;s longevity, based on the broken back of Sega.<\/p>\n<p>Sega Dreamcast, honor, and burned games<br \/>\n3\/9\/2001&#8211; OK, I understand that many of you like to use burned games, but none of you (I hope) have any delusions about their legality, they are illegal. That said, I am not condoning the use of the games, but I am not about to make a judgment call there so lets continue. Well, we&#8217;ve all heard of half.com right? Get movies and games half price. Why are the games so cheap? BECAUSE MANY OF THEM ARE BURNED! Listen to me or learn this the hard way. I ordered a dreamcast game (a capcom vs. title) thinking I was getting a good deal for a 20 spot&#8230; Yeah right! It comes in the mail, and guess what&#8230;it&#8217;s burned! What a load of crap, it&#8217;s not even guaranteed to work at all. To make it worse, the guy sends me a gameshark cd &#8220;free&#8221; so that the deal will seem sweeter. Lets see&#8230;.WHY HEY, LOOKIE HERE, IT&#8217;S BURNED!! Trying to remain calm I think it over, I just paid 20 freaking dollars for 60 cents worth of burned disks!!!!! Argh ahhhh, to quote scorpion* circa 1992, if thoughts could kill 50% of the world&#8217;s population would&#8217;ve just dropped dead. If I wanted a janked up crack and a burned cd i would&#8217;ve made it myself. The worst of it is I can&#8217;t get my cash back, that&#8217;s right I&#8217;m forced to spend more money or break the law. Whether or not the disk works is not the point, I&#8217;m just pissed I was forced into it. Even worse, I&#8217;m forced into another ethical dillema, should I write the guy asking for my money back, should I rat him out, a cardinal sin among gamers? Of course I&#8217;m not going to rat his ass out, but with me getting screwed over a lot lately I&#8217;ve been getting a little pissed at the way things have been going. Oh, and the guy&#8217;s not a guy, he&#8217;s a regular corporation. So he&#8217;s ripping off a ton of people this way. A regular street husler-type. I can&#8217;t exactly force him to email people that his games are burned either, to bring in some kind of authority breaks the code. I guess it&#8217;s another polite letter time.

Because the mechanics of the Tellah character did not allow his magic points to go above 98, and the meteo spell cost 99 magic points. Clever eh? No extra programming was needed, just a simple magic-point cap. So when Tellah does cast meteo in a fit of rage and justice, it kills him. Poetically simple, and just as sweet. An excellent game and if you don&#8217;t own it I highly recommend finding a copy. (Or just buy the game, then download the emulator, that way everything is nice and legal.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Online Ordering, Magic Cards, and About getting Ripped off&#8230;<br \/>\n2\/26\/2001&#8211; Well, another Monday went buy without too much hassle. Had a fairly tough logic and design test, and I really should work on my Combinatorics homework, but those of you who know me should know better. I&#8217;m still waiting on my dreamcast and games, I have high hopes for the system, even if it commercially failed. Tomorrow I go in to the career office to try to find a job in the game industry. I hope I hope I hope. I sent away some of my old magic cards about a month ago, to this place in Florida, and have yet to receive payment. I know that things happen, but this is a bit distressing. It&#8217;s been about 10 days since his last email where he apologized for not having sent the money earlier. I sent a partial-threatening letter yesterday, and hope that I will get my check soon. There&#8217;s the real sad part, the money. I was not desperate for the cash, but think of some kid who sent away his magic collection in hopes of getting some new cards (or a dreamcast, or heck, a computer (imagine that ;)) I&#8217;ve lost a lot of respect for the gaming industry, but who knows, maybe, just maybe I&#8217;ll get that 80 bucks and feel better. Ya know what&#8217;s really strange? Directx programming has a direct correlation to the topics we&#8217;re covering in object oriented programming right now, strange huh? Who would&#8217;ve thought a course at this school would pan out&#8230;<br \/>\nJust another lazy Sunday&#8230;<br \/>\n2\/25\/2001&#8211; Well, it&#8217;s Sunday again and there is much studying to do&#8230; Yeah right. Anxiously awaiting the arrival of my new dreamcast game I sit around on our new couch, bored. I updated the site with some archived programs from last year, I haven&#8217;t been motivated enough to compile them in Windows or add graphics so they&#8217;re plain old unix style command line programs. I can&#8217;t wait till my new programming book comes in next week, My goal is to program Pac-Morse my the end of spring break. Let me clue you guys in, Dr Morse is my academic advisor and object-oriented teacher. I like the guy, but sometimes we students feel like little pellets being gobbled up, like in a Pac-man game. Well, I ordered a new book on graphs and game programming in C++ so I&#8217;m making Pac-Morse my first goal. Tomorrow I go down to apply at various game companies with my career counselor, wish me luck&#8230;<br \/>\nBeginnings&#8230;.<br \/>\n2\/23\/01&#8211;Well, here I am, programming a web site to showcase my programs, and I only have 1 program I want to put up. Typical, computer programmers seem to be the perfectionist type, until it&#8217;s time to turn in a program for class. Therein lies the rub, for the more anal retentive the programmer, the more errors he will choose to ignore in a program forced upon him by his school or institution.

any number of Python graphing utilities. \u00a0Just make sure you output the correct \u2018include\u2019 statement.\n\n1. Include matplotlib\n2. Set a variable for X values equal to your range(0,rangetop)\n3. Set a variable for Y values which are equal to the data you wish to graph, you can add elements to this array in a loop etc\n4. Set the axis scaling for an appropriate range if you don\u2019t wish to auto-scale\n5. Plot the graph!\n\n**Having your Logs Animate Data**\n\nThis one is just a minor tweak on the above graph.\n\n1. Include matplotlib and time\n2. Call ion() before your animation loop\n3. Set a variable for X values equal to your range(0,rangetop)\n4. Set a variable for Y values which are equal to the data you wish to graph, you can add elements to this array in a loop etc\n5. Set the axis scaling for an appropriate range if you don\u2019t wish to auto-scale\n6. set a variable equal to your Plot the graph function\n7. Update the Y values you wish to change in your animation\n8. Update the Y values in the graph with a call to variable.set_ydata(Updated Y Values)\n9. Call plot.draw() after the y values have been set. \u00a0You may wan to call this 20 or 30 times to match your desired frames per second.\n\n**Having your Logs Process and Email Data**\n\nThis works best if your program output is being piped or executed directly after program execution. \u00a0Let\u2019s say you know the content of your output in advance, and want to match it to an MD5 hash previously known\n\n1. Import md5 and smtplib\n2. Set a variable to md5.new(\u2018your data to be md5 validated\u2019).digest(), this is your generated md5 hash\n3.

times, I\u2019ve seen and written my fair share of resumes. \u00a0Clean white sheets tree pulp embossed and inked with the\u00a0accomplishments\u00a0of the writer. \u00a0What an outdated system! \u00a0Worse still are the PDF and Word resumes, emulating the old pulp and ink model. \u00a0Ignoring the fact that you can\u2019t convey motion, video, or interactivity in a paper resume, the main downside from my perspective is a lack of open source spirit. \u00a0All these resumes floating around and they\u2019ve never taught anyone anything besides a written history of a job candidate. \u00a0Bleh.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/impressjsresumecontents-300x232.png \"impressjsresumecontents\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/impressjsresumecontents.png)\n\nSo I set out to change that. \u00a0I\u2019m re-writing my resume as an HTML page with CSS transforms and interactive Javascript and HTML5 elements. \u00a0I\u2019ve also released the project as open source on GitHub, so anyone can follow along as I learn more about impress.js, snag the source for their own resume, or just poke around at the guts. \u00a0I\u2019ve started preliminary work on the resume, and it\u2019ll get updated steadily as I get more free time. \u00a0I realized after the first couple of commits that I\u2019d like to have a live version of the latest code always available online. \u00a0Preferably without any interaction or external script wizardry from me. \u00a0As it turns out, It\u2019s no easy task to accomplish through the use of GitHub Pages and git submodules. \u00a0My resume pulls impress.JS as a Git submodule, but GitHub doesn\u2019t forward links to submodules in Pages. \u00a0The end result is that the use of another open source project as a submodule is not a viable option for GitHub Pages sites. \u00a0This is unfortunate, but I

times, I&#8217;ve seen and written my fair share of resumes. \u00a0Clean white sheets tree pulp embossed and inked with the\u00a0accomplishments\u00a0of the writer. \u00a0What an outdated system! \u00a0Worse still are the PDF and Word resumes, emulating the old pulp and ink model. \u00a0Ignoring the fact that you can&#8217;t convey motion, video, or interactivity in a paper resume, the main downside from my perspective is a lack of open source spirit. \u00a0All these resumes floating around and they&#8217;ve never taught anyone anything besides a written history of a job candidate. \u00a0Bleh.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/impressjsresumecontents.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2592\"

HTML5 elements. \u00a0I&#8217;ve also released the project as open source on GitHub, so anyone can follow along as I learn more about impress.js, snag the source for their own resume, or just poke around at the guts. \u00a0I&#8217;ve started preliminary work on the resume, and it&#8217;ll get updated steadily as I get more free time. \u00a0I realized after the first couple of commits that I&#8217;d like to have a live version of the latest code always available online. \u00a0Preferably without any interaction or external script wizardry from me. \u00a0As it turns out, It&#8217;s no easy task to accomplish through the use of GitHub Pages and git submodules. \u00a0My resume pulls impress.JS as a Git submodule, but GitHub doesn&#8217;t forward links to submodules in Pages. \u00a0The end result is that the use of another open source project as a submodule is not a viable option for GitHub Pages sites. \u00a0This is unfortunate, but I worked around it using the tools

Sources! (I released 70 open source projects today)","slug":"i-released-70-open-source-projects-today","markdown":"\nI\u2019ve been studying my site and app traffic for a while now, and I\u2019ve come to a very sure conclusion. Open-sourcing an app does nothing to decrease app sales or ad traffic, but increases web traffic significantly. Therefore I\u2019ve decided to open source everything I\u2019ve ever done, BSD licensed so you can use it at work.\n\nSeriously, all the sources. Every one. To start with, I\u2019ve created repositories for the roughly 70 Android applications I\u2019ve released. As of today, you can browse through them all on my [GitHub account page](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis).\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/74BzSTQCl_c?feature=player_embedded\" width=\"640\"><\/iframe>\n\nUnfortunately for me, the task of open sourcing 100+ projects is a daunting one, so I set about writing a script to troll my folders and create GitHub projects. This script itself is also available on GitHub [here](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/createGitHubscript). Read on for more info about the construction of the script.\n\n  \n I started with a folder full of my android applications, but you can apply this to any set of directories.

Want to run an obscure Linux app on your rooted android tablet? Maybe you want to do some Wireshark Snooping, run a Linux game with sound, or download a set of Linux images at maximum speed? With the convergence of a few awesome technologies, we can now install and run pretty much any Linux application or environment on your Android device. Follow the steps below or check out some of the example photos of apps running on my Dell Streak 7.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/CameraZOOM-20120520183639702-300x225.jpg \"CameraZOOM-20120520183639702\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/CameraZOOM-20120520183639702.jpg)\n\n1. Install Linux in a chrooted environment, you can use [Install Linux](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.galoula.LinuxInstall) from the app store to save time.\n2. (For first-timers, open setup under the \u2018menu\u2019 in \u2018Install Linux\u2019, allow writing to root filesystem and set your loop device size and you should be good to go)\n3. For more advanced users, choose \u2018Armhp\u2019 for the hard floating point speed improvements and Debian testing for the additional package support. There will be some broken packages as a result from both, but the performance increase is worth it.\n4. Install [Xserver ](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=au.com.darkside.XServer&)(for graphical apps), or you can use a [VNC client](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=android.androidVNC) if you wish.\n5. Install an [SSH client](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=org.connectbot) to connect to your installation\n6. Run the \u2018X Server\u2019 application\n7. Connect to localhost via terminal (select \u2018local\u2019 in connectbot), run \u2018linuxchroot\u2019. This will give you a root console on your local Linux installation if you like.\n8. Switch back to your terminal and set your display variable with `export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0.0`\n9. Still in the terminal, install xterminal with `apt-get install xterm`. This will install a bunch of X prerequisites as well.\n10. Fire up an X terminal for your X Server app with `xterm &`\n11. The X terminal process will continue to run in the background, so switch on over to your \u2018X Server\u2019 application and you should see your XTerm!\n12. From here the sky\u2019s the limit. You can install a window manager, try out expiramental packages, play games with sound, install SSH and FTP servers, etc.\n\nLet\u2019s say there\u2019s an extremely rare Linux distribution from Russia that you can only download from an encrypted private torrent tracker. These things happen, but your android bittorrent application may not support protocol encryption. This is easy to do with your new Linux install.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/CameraZOOM-20120520170429856-300x225.jpg \"CameraZOOM-20120520170429856\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/CameraZOOM-20120520170429856.jpg)\n\n1. Open up a console either graphical or text as describe above.\n2. Install your client of choice (deluge, say) with `apt-get install deluge`\n3. Fire it on up with `deluge &`\n4. Add the Torrent\n5. Voila! Even with the crappy screens on most Android tablets it\u2019s pretty useful. (check out my 800\u00d7480 Streak downloading an Ubuntu torrent)\n6.

Touchscreen Classic Dos RPGs on Android","slug":"fun-pro-tip-touchscreen-classic-dos-rpgs-on-android","markdown":"\nIf you grew up in the 80s or early nineties, there\u2019s a good chance you remember the AD&D goldbox series from SSI. These were top-down strategic RPG games based on the advanced dungeons and dragons pen and paper RPG series. While the first (Pools of Radiance) was my favorite, there were at least 10 or 11 others to play. Then there\u2019s the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, X-Com, Master of Magic, Wizardry, Bards Tale, Albion, Superhero League of Hoboken, and about 1000 others. These games were great fun back in the day, but with some of the new improvements to DosBox you can actually improve the original experience on your Android handset or tablet.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick guide for playing your classic games with touchscreen and transparent keyboard on your Android.\n\n1. Install a DosBox port for Android. I highly recommend DosBox Turbo, as they are bleeding edge.\n2. If you\u2019re using DosBox Turbo, also install \u2018DosBox Manager\u2019, it adds easy custom DosBox Profile Support\n3. Locate the game you wish to play, and extract it to a directory on your android. I recommend \/dosbox\/GameName\/\n4. Install a good software keyboard for Android. I recommend \u2018Hackers Keyboard\u2019, as it comes with a transparent theme you can select\n5. Fire up Dosbox Manager, or manually edit your DosBox.cfg to have an appropriate amount of memory (32mb) and low frameskip\n6. While you\u2019re editing the config, go ahead and enable mouse support, with absolute (perfect for touchscreen!) positioning\n7. Finally, edit the autoexec.bat in the config and add a couple of lines to start your game such as \u2018cd dosbox\/gamename\/\u2019 \u2018startgame\u2019\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/albion-150x150.png \"albion\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/albion.png) [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/hoboken2-150x150.png \"hoboken2\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/hoboken2.png) [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/hoboken-150x150.png \"hoboken\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/hoboken.png) [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/doslist-150x150.png \"doslist\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/doslist.png) [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/azurebonds-150x150.png \"azurebonds\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/azurebonds.png) [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/albion-150x150.png \"albion\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/albion.png)\n\nUpdate \u2013 Wizardry 7 by special request:\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-21-29-150x150.png \"Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-21-29\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-21-29.png) [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-24-53-150x150.png \"Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-24-53\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-24-53.png) [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-25-59-150x150.png \"Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-25-59\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-25-59.png) [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-26-03-150x150.png \"Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-26-03\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-26-03.png) [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-26-25-150x150.png \"Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-26-25\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-26-25.png) [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-27-02-150x150.png \"Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-27-02\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Screenshot_2012-07-05-19-27-02.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>If you grew up in the 80s or early nineties, there&#8217;s a good chance you remember the AD&#038;D goldbox series from SSI.

Some of them were games. All of them were written under a \u201cone app in one day\u201d constraint and as such the games never had any sound. No sound effects, no background music, no waveform generation, nothing. Fast forward a year and they\u2019ve all become open source on GitHub. I\u2019d wanted to update them all while re-using as much code as possible. How then was I to maximize the effect (all the games get all the features) while minimizing the effort of adding sound to all of those previous games simultaneously? And how best to share the effort with other Android programmers? In this, the first of a three part article series, you\u2019ll find out. For part 1, I create the project, setup the environment, make a plan, and update the waveform generation code on my currently in-market apps. You can follow-along with this article series in real-time by watching the commit log to the [Android Simple Game Audio](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/Android_Simple_Game_Audio) project on GitHub. And stay-tuned for the upcoming part 2, wherein I become a Foley artist and make use of some interesting and (not quite) antiquated technology.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/soundatlast-1024x404.png \"soundatlast\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/soundatlast.png)\n\n**[Creating an Android Library Project](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2012\/07\/21\/android-sound\/#a1)**  \n**[Including an Android Library Project in Your Android Project (Yo Dawg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2012\/07\/21\/android-sound\/#a2)**  \n**[Planning (Knowing Exactly What You Want To Accomplish)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2012\/07\/21\/android-sound\/#a4)**  \n**[Iterating (One Feature At A Time)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2012\/07\/21\/android-sound\/#a5)**  \n**[Low Bar: Waveform Generation](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2012\/07\/21\/android-sound\/#a6)**  \n**[Update Your Markets and Ad Copy](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2012\/07\/21\/android-sound\/#a12)**  \n**[Mid Goal: Sound Effects](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2012\/07\/21\/android-sound\/#a7)**\n\n**[Creating an Android Library Project]()**\n\nThis is a good time to talk about workspace organization. Whenever starting a new project that is going to touch a bunch of my other projects, I like to create a new development workspace. As I use eclipse for Android development, this has the effect of lowering my overall build-all time (as only relevant projects are in the workspace to be built). For this project, I picked the 13 most relevant Android apps that contained patterns or code I was likely to re-use.\n\nThis tends to confuse people, but Android library projects are simply regular Android projects with the \u2018is Library\u2019 flag set. You\u2019ll still need to declare any activities you create in the manifest, but for the most part you can simply tick \u2018is library\u2019 during your project setup and you\u2019re good to go.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/islibrary-300x167.png \"islibrary\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/islibrary.png)\n\n**[Including an Android Library Project in Your Android Project (Yo Dawg)]()**\n\nNow that you\u2019ve created your library project, you\u2019ll need to include it in your other Android apps. Fire up Eclipse, open up the project properties and head down to the \u2018Android\u2019 tab. Scroll down to the \u2018Library\u2019 section, select your previously created library project as a \u2018library\u2019 and you\u2019re good to go.\n\n**[Planning (Knowing Exactly What You Want To Accomplish)]()**\n\nSometimes the hardest part of a project is figuring out the features you *don\u2019t* want to implement. Gather up all the projects that you\u2019ll wish to use your library, and consider the features they\u2019ll need. There should be a base feature set that emerges across all projects. That is your first release. For the \u2018Easy Sound Manager\u2019 library, there were three main features I needed.  \n 1. Waveform Generation (code re-use from Super Whistle)  \n 2. Sound Effects (with thread pool etc, code re-use from Easy Sound Board\/AirBeats)  \n 3. Background Music (intelligent handling, code re-use from AirBeats)\n\n**[Iterating (One Feature At A Time)]()**\n\nLike a recursive algorithm or a marathon runner, you\u2019ll need to start somewhere and push forward hard if you\u2019re going to get anywhere. I like to split feature implementation up into daily chunks that I can finish up in what little spare time I get. For this project which featured three main feature sets, it was an easy workload to divvy.\n\n**[Low Bar: Waveform Generation]()**\n\nQuite a few of my apps were waveform generators of some sort, so I first set about to take the waveform generation from \u2018Super Whistle\u2019 and port it over to my \u2018Easy Sound Manager\u2019 library. Super whistle was using a simple runnable wrapped from within a \u2018play frequency\u2019 function. I ported that over, made it a bit more generic (adjustable playtime), and added a couple of niceness functions for \u2018play note\u2019 and \u2018play random note\u2019. I also switched from using threads to using asynctasks, which are recommended for background operations with easy thread management. Once I had implemented these new features, I set about to back-port this into Super Whistle.\n\nFirst, I added \u2018EasyAudioManager\u2019 as a library class to Super Whistle. I then removed all audio manager classes and references from Super Whistle, and hooked up the new \u2018Easy Sound Manager\u2019 class. I then made sure that the \u2018stop\u2019 button was still being handled by the implementation, and proceeded to update GitHub and Google Play Market with new code and binaries.\n\n**[Update Your Markets and Ad Copy]()**\n\nWhen updating a game or app for the Google Play Market, it\u2019s a good idea to update your ad copy and version numbers, strings, etc to reflect your newly added features. Also note that the simple act of making the app smaller, faster, more intelligent on the back-end, etc are totally acceptable features for releases. Release often to keep momentum, as they say. You may want to update your Ad Banners to include a \u2018NEW FEATURE HERE!\u2019 stamp or sub-banner. These sorts of things may seem cheesy but they do catch the eye, just make sure to keep it informative. A user can understand a red ribbon banner with a new feature if it\u2019s informative to them. Keep it descriptive and positive with short info-packed sentences like \u201cNow with Audio!\u201d, \u201cNew Sound Effects!\u201d, \u201cFaster Audio Engine!\u201d, etc.\n\nWith one project already updated in the Play market and the \u2018Easy Audio Manager\u2019 library coming along nicely, it was time to move on to planning for the \u2018mid-goal\u2019: Sound Effects.\n\n**[Mid Goal: Sound Effects]()**\n\nFor me, an open source sound effects library needs to include features that make it stand out or more usable than the competitors. This is difficult in the case of a game sound library as Google has gone to great lengths to make writing simple audio (not real-time or analysis etc, but simple audio) effects and background music trivial. Most implementations will be little more than wrappers around SDK examples and bug fixes for various platforms. That being the case, I think that the inclusion of actual sound effects I\u2019ve created and released under a Creative Commons license will help make this a useful contribution. What that means is even if you\u2019re not interested in the source code or waveform generators etc, you can still download the project and use all of the bleeps and bloops that I create in your own projects, for FREE, forever. So if you\u2019re playing one of my games, and you hear a ting or a hi-hat or a roaring \u2018Game Over\u2019; that\u2019s actually me in my kitchen with some pots and pans and spoons and a microphone cooking up some mischief (like 90s west coast rap). Same goes for when you\u2019re jamming on the background music. That\u2019ll be out there too (Part 3 of this article series will cover background music). One will just need to head to the [Easy Game Audio project on GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/Android_Simple_Game_Audio) to grab the newest set of files. But how to capture these sounds in a clear and clean way, using easily accessible audio editing software (open source, of course!) and the hardware I have around my workbench (well ok, a [laptop stand](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2012\/04\/25\/quick-pro-tip-add-a-tablet-holder-to-your-laptop-table\/))?\n\nFor the answers to those questions, you\u2019ll have to wait for part 2 of this article series. Coming soon! And remember, if you\u2019re itching for the next article and you\u2019re wondering how things are coming along, you can always grab the latest source code from the project\u2019s [GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/Android_Simple_Game_Audio).\n\n\n","html":"<p>About a year ago, I wrote many, many Android apps.

My (sometimes many-years old now) articles on minor gaming hacks remain popular today, and I still respond to comments and questions from other hackers following along. After years of waiting, the English port of La-Mulana was finally released on WiiWare. I rushed out to purchase it, and realized that I hadn\u2019t turned on my Wii in a long, LONG time. Upon testing, it turns out my [Wii\u2019s](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2011\/05\/04\/no-solder-no-tools-no-trouble-usb-wii-sensor-bar-conversion\/) DVD drive finally died (after 5+ years of duty), and I was beginning to notice how much time it took to cart the Wii around to various rooms of the house. Besides all that it just seemed a waste to leave the Wii motherboard in that ugly white shell, strapped to a broken DVD drive for the remainder of its life.\n\nSo I decided to make a hack of it. I transferred all of my Wii Disc games onto a WBFS formatted hard drive, soft-modded my Wii using the SD card slot, and began construction on my \u2018Wii in a treasure box\u2019. Read on for all the details and a ton of photos.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/SneakPreviewWiiHack-300x206.png \"SneakPreviewWiiHack\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/SneakPreviewWiiHack.png)\n\nThe first thing I needed to do was to remove all the parts of the Wii that were not necessary or no longer useful. The front plate and buttons had no more use (power-on via infra-red is much easier), neither did the DVD drive and loading mechanism. The outer case was no longer needed, and the Gamecube cover and ports, while still working, were not a necessity.\n\n<table><tr><td>[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0099-150x150.jpg \"IMAG0099\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0099.jpg)<\/td><td>[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0100-150x150.jpg \"IMAG0100\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0100.jpg)<\/td><td>[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0102-150x150.jpg \"IMAG0102\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0102.jpg)<\/td><td>[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0101-150x150.jpg \"IMAG0101\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0101.jpg)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>I found an old treasure box that had been sitting in a closet for a while, and decided it would make a fine new case for the Wii. Upon examining the case, it occurred to me that I would be able to fit much more than the Wii itself into the case. I started by finding a cookie-tin that was the appropriate size to shield the Wii from the heat of my external hard drive.

My (sometimes many-years old now) articles on minor gaming hacks remain popular today, and I still respond to comments and questions from other hackers following along.  After years of waiting, the English port of La-Mulana was finally released on WiiWare.  I rushed out to purchase it, and realized that I hadn&#8217;t turned on my Wii in a long, LONG time.  Upon testing, it turns out my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2011\/05\/04\/no-solder-no-tools-no-trouble-usb-wii-sensor-bar-conversion\/\">Wii&#8217;s<\/a> DVD drive finally died (after 5+ years of duty), and I was beginning to notice how much time it took to cart the Wii around to various rooms of the house.  Besides all that it just seemed a waste to leave the Wii motherboard in that ugly white shell, strapped to a broken DVD drive for the remainder of its life.<\/p>\n<p>So I decided to make a hack of it.  I transferred all of my Wii Disc games onto a WBFS formatted hard drive, soft-modded my Wii using the SD card slot, and began construction on my &#8216;Wii in a treasure box&#8217;.

For my next article, I&#8217;ll likely add a front temperature LCD and do some experimentation around this functionality.  <\/p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0131.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0131-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMAG0131\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3281\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0131-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0131-96x96.jpg 96w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0131-24x24.jpg 24w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0131-36x36.jpg 36w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0131-48x48.jpg 48w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0131-64x64.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0137.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0137-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMAG0137\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3282\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0137-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0137-96x96.jpg 96w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0137-24x24.jpg 24w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0137-36x36.jpg 36w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0137-48x48.jpg 48w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0137-64x64.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0141.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0141-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMAG0141\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3283\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0141-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0141-96x96.jpg 96w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0141-24x24.jpg 24w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0141-36x36.jpg 36w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0141-48x48.jpg 48w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0141-64x64.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG01461.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG01461-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMAG0146\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3284\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG01461-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG01461-96x96.jpg 96w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG01461-24x24.jpg 24w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG01461-36x36.jpg 36w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG01461-48x48.jpg 48w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG01461-64x64.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<p>Till next time, hack (and game) on folks!

I decided to ride over to the local thrift shop and peruse the aisles. Nothing great came from the furniture section, but something caught my eye in the electronics area. Encased there among the mile-high stack of dead and antiquated printers was an old epson multi-function printer\/scan\/fix. Something about it called to me, and it\u2019s huge bulky frame almost guaranteed that no-one would purchase it, even for the 4$ price it was being offered at. I purchased it, and began the process of disassembly.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"394\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7RZ7xkqhfmA?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\"><\/iframe>\n\nRead on for the full story and more photos.\n\nThe first thing I needed to do was to remove the glass from the scanner portion of the printer. It was glued on there fairly solidly, but 15 minutes with the hair dryer had it hot enough to pry off without cracking the glass. From there, I removed the scanner and motor portion of the top plate, and began the process of disassembling the LCD.\n\nThe LCD was a fairly standard 2003 model 19\u2033 1440\u00d7900 widescreen monitor. This means there\u2019s a bit of wiggle-room when it comes to aligning the power regulator and driver (as they\u2019re connected at the top of the panel only. Some newer LCDS have connection on all 4 corners, and are a bit trickier to mount inside a strange container. Luckily, this was a straightforward set of 10 screws holding in a couple of small speakers, the rear power driver, and the panel itself. Snip snap screw, ready to mount. I used a hot glue gun on a couple of strategic places around the LCD to keep it in place, then used liquid cement to bond it into the scanner panel. Thirty minutes later, the LCD portion was ready to go. I ran the cables down through the paper feed slot and into the under-carriage, and began the process of gutting the printer itself.\n\n<table><tr><td>[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0022-150x150.jpg \"IMAG0022\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0022.jpg)<\/td><td>[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0025-150x150.jpg \"IMAG0025\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0025.jpg)<\/td><td>[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0026-150x150.jpg \"IMAG0026\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0026.jpg)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>Printers are a bit nastier inside than most electronics.

That\u2019s just about the perfect price for a hack enclosure, especially for a prototype. I set about removing all the screws (over 100) from the printer, followed by the gears, foam padding, cables, ribbons, and much of the inner plastic ribbing. There\u2019s honestly a surprising amount of foam padding in a printer, so have a trash bag ready.\n\n<table><tr><td>[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0029-150x150.jpg \"IMAG0029\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0029.jpg)<\/td><td>[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0030-150x150.jpg \"IMAG0030\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0030.jpg)<\/td><td>[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0033-150x150.jpg \"IMAG0033\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0033.jpg)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>After it was all removed, I used a hack-saw to cut the inner plastic moulding to be a Dreamcast-lid shaped hole.

Finally, I super-glued a square bit of plastic foam on inner side of the LCD to keep everything level and braced when the \u201cprinter\u201d is closed.

Encased there among the mile-high stack of dead and antiquated printers was an old epson multi-function printer\/scan\/fix.  Something about it called to me, and it&#8217;s huge bulky frame almost guaranteed that no-one would purchase it, even for the 4$ price it was being offered at.  I purchased it, and began the process of disassembly.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7RZ7xkqhfmA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Read on for the full story and more photos.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>The first thing I needed to do was to remove the glass from the scanner portion of the printer.  It was glued on there fairly solidly, but 15 minutes with the hair dryer had it hot enough to pry off without cracking the glass.  From there, I removed the scanner and motor portion of the top plate, and began the process of disassembling the LCD.<\/p>\n<p>The LCD was a fairly standard 2003 model 19&#8243; 1440&#215;900 widescreen monitor.  This means there&#8217;s a bit of wiggle-room when it comes to aligning the power regulator and driver (as they&#8217;re connected at the top of the panel only.  Some newer LCDS have connection on all 4 corners, and are a bit trickier to mount inside a strange container.  Luckily, this was a straightforward set of 10 screws holding in a couple of small speakers, the rear power driver, and the panel itself.  Snip snap screw, ready to mount.  I used a hot glue gun on a couple of strategic places around the LCD to keep it in place, then used liquid cement to bond it into the scanner panel.  Thirty minutes later, the LCD portion was ready to go.  I ran the cables down through the paper feed slot and into the under-carriage, and began the process of gutting the printer itself.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0022.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0022-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMAG0022\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3303\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0022-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0022-96x96.jpg 96w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0022-24x24.jpg 24w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0022-36x36.jpg 36w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0022-48x48.jpg 48w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0022-64x64.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0025.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0025-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMAG0025\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3304\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0025-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0025-96x96.jpg 96w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0025-24x24.jpg 24w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0025-36x36.jpg 36w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0025-48x48.jpg 48w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0025-64x64.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0026.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0026-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMAG0026\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3305\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0026-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0026-96x96.jpg 96w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0026-24x24.jpg 24w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0026-36x36.jpg 36w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0026-48x48.jpg 48w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0026-64x64.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<p>Printers are a bit nastier inside than most electronics.

That&#8217;s just about the perfect price for a hack enclosure, especially for a prototype.  I set about removing all the screws (over 100) from the printer, followed by the gears, foam padding, cables, ribbons, and much of the inner plastic ribbing.  There&#8217;s honestly a surprising amount of foam padding in a printer, so have a trash bag ready.  <\/p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0029.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0029-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMAG0029\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3306\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0029-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0029-96x96.jpg 96w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0029-24x24.jpg 24w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0029-36x36.jpg 36w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0029-48x48.jpg 48w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0029-64x64.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0030.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0030-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMAG0030\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3307\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0030-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0030-96x96.jpg 96w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0030-24x24.jpg 24w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0030-36x36.jpg 36w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0030-48x48.jpg 48w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0030-64x64.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0033.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0033-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMAG0033\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3308\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0033-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0033-96x96.jpg 96w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0033-24x24.jpg 24w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0033-36x36.jpg 36w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0033-48x48.jpg 48w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0033-64x64.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<p>After it was all removed, I used a hack-saw to cut the inner plastic moulding to be a Dreamcast-lid shaped hole.

You can find these online for this price range at the usual deals sites, and often have video-in.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0103.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0103-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMAG0103\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3331\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0103-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0103-96x96.jpg 96w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0103-24x24.jpg 24w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0103-36x36.jpg 36w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0103-48x48.jpg 48w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMAG0103-64x64.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I started by removing the battery from the DVD player to bring the weight down.

readers.\n\nFirst, I spent a bit of time on the Dreamcast coffee table, adding a set of chair wheels for mobility, and a hook beneath for holding the controllers, and replacing the plastic leveling shim with a nice metallic U-grip built from an old flat wrench.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/IMAG0210-300x168.jpg \"IMAG0210\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/IMAG0210.jpg)\n\nSecond, I took apart an old 1972 electronic slide rule calculator while scavenging for parts.

I\u2019ve been all over town recording audio samples on my little boom mic, learned quite a bit about basic audio and recording techniques, and received a ton of excellent feedback from friends and strangers alike. My original intention was simply to update all of my previous Android apps to use my new audio library, but the sparks of creativity cannot be contained. I am therefore starting work on a new minigame collection titled \u20185 seconds\u2019. It will; of course, be fully open source. Expect cameos from all of my previous game characters and a good dose of fun. You can also expect site updates describing the game development process and how \u20185 Seconds\u2019 is evolving. You can checkout the GitHub page for it [here](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/FiveSeconds).\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/fivesecondstitle.png \"fivesecondstitle\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/fivesecondstitle.png)\n\n**[]()Using the Hardware at Hand**\n\nHaving tried to record some audio clips with my low-end android phone, I became convinced that this was not the way to move forward. Digging through my parts box, I found a (now obsolete) Sony Minidisc recorder and a Memorex 1\/4\u2033 high impedance microphone. I used an old Seiko in-line guitar tuner and some RCA patch cables to bring the Microphone line to the 3.5mm input on the Minidisc recorder. Not the prettiest setup, but it gave me ~10 feet of line to work with, certainly enough for a boom pole. Unfortunately I wasn\u2019t bringing the level up enough, and the recording level was too low.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/CameraZOOM-20120722163528873-300x225.jpg \"Microphone Setup\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/CameraZOOM-20120722163528873.jpg)\n\nNext I tried using a standard computer headset. This worked well in that the level was much improved, but the mic had terrible range. I finally settled on a \u2018TV microphone\u2019 from my \u201980\u2019s junk\u2019 box. The audio was coming in at an appropriate level and I had plenty of 3.5mm extension cables to work with. My portable mic setup was ready to go.\n\n**[]()Capture List, Gotta Capt\u2019 em All!**\n\nEach of the games I\u2019m updating for this article (see list below) have their own sound effects requirements. Luckily, there are a number of similar elements and themes running through my games that lend themselves to audio re-use. A bullet is a bullet, lightning sounds like lightning, etc. Knowing in advance what types of sounds I\u2019m trying to capture helps dramatically with the process. So, as usual, I compiled a set of lists and looked for duplicates (**in bold**).\n\nCustom Action Tap\n\n1. **Menu Checkbox Noise**\n2. **Tap**\n3. **Kill**\n4. **Miss**\n5. **Bomb**\n6. **Lightning**\n7. **Death**\n8. **Gain a Life**\n9. **Game Over**\n10. Armageddon\n11. Fire Crackle\n12. Fire Spread\n13. Fire Dies\n14. Freeze Bomb\n15. Baloon Pop\n16. Hammer of Thor Appears\n17. Hammer Kill\n\nCustom Comets\n\n1. **Menu Checkbox Noise**\n2. **Tap**\n3. **Kill**\n4. **Miss**\n5. **Bullet**\n6. **Lose a Life**\n7. **Reverse Fire Mode**\n8. **Enemy Split**\n9. **Game Over**\n\nCustom Onslaught\n\n1. **Menu Checkbox Noise**\n2. **Tap**\n3. **Kill**\n4. **Miss**\n5. **Bullet**\n6. **Lose a Life**\n7. **Reverse Fire Mode**\n8. **Enemy Split**\n9. **Level Up**\n10. **Game Over**\n11. Weapon Upgrade\n12. Double Bullet\n13. Triple Bullet\n14. Shotgun\n15. Boomstick\n\nCustom Pong (Not on market due to Atari Pong Copyright Takedown)\n\n1. **Menu Checkbox Noise**\n2. **Game Over**\n3. Ping\n4. Pong\n\nSkillful Dodge\n\n1. **Menu Checkbox Noise**\n2. **Game Over**\n3. Walkin Around\n4. Hit a Tree\n\nSkillful Lines\n\n1. **Menu Checkbox Noise**\n2. **Game Over**\n3. **ScreenShot**\n4. **Save Score**\n\nSkillful Surround\n\n1. **Menu Checkbox Noise**\n2. **Game Over**\n3. **ScreenShot**\n4. **Save Score**\n5. Doodle Noise\n\nThe Grind\n\n1. **Menu Checkbox Noise**\n2. **Level Up**\n3. Grinding Wheel\n4. Enemy Attacks\n5. Player Attacks\n6. Enemy Spell\n7. Player Spell\n8. Auto-Grind\n9. Enemy Drops loot\n10. Player Learns Spell\n11. New SubQuest\n12. New Quest\n13. Resting Up\n14. Player Healing\n15. Enemy Healing\n16. Weapon Up\n17. Armor Up\n18. Helmet Up\n19. One Year Older\n20. Stats Up\n\nAs you can see, there are a number of duplicate needs that can be served by a single sound file in the library. Please note, I am saying library in the \u2018GitHub project\u2019 sense. All of the sound files will not be included in all of the projects themselves or in the android library because that\u2019s just inefficient and causes the library size to grow all sorts of huge.\n\nThe final list of sounds to capture for this first iteration of the library ended up being the below 53 sounds.\n\n1. **Menu Checkbox Noise**\n2. **Tap**\n3. **Kill**\n4. **Miss**\n5. **Bomb**\n6. **Lightning**\n7. **Death**\n8. **Gain a Life**\n9. **Game Over**\n10. **Bullet**\n11. **Lose a Life**\n12. **Reverse Fire Mode**\n13. **Enemy Split**\n14. **Level Up**\n15. **Game Over**\n16. **ScreenShot**\n17. **Save Score**\n18. Armageddon\n19. Doodle Noise\n20. Weapon Upgrade\n21. Double Bullet\n22. Triple Bullet\n23. Shotgun\n24. Boomstick\n25. Fire Crackle\n26. Fire Spread\n27. Fire Dies\n28. Freeze Bomb\n29. Baloon Pop\n30. Hammer of Thor Appears\n31. Hammer Kill\n32. Ping\n33. Pong\n34. Walkin Around\n35. Hit a Tree\n36. Grinding Wheel\n37. Enemy Attacks\n38. Player Attacks\n39. Enemy Spell\n40. Player Spell\n41. Auto-Grind\n42. Enemy Drops loot\n43. Player Learns Spell\n44. New SubQuest\n45. New Quest\n46. Resting Up\n47. Player Healing\n48. Enemy Healing\n49. Weapon Up\n50. Armor Up\n51. Helmet Up\n52. One Year Older\n53. Stats Up\n\n**[]()Fun with Audio Capture**\n\nNow that I had a portable audio recording system set up that could produce decent results (with a far greater range than my cell-phone microphone), it was time to go out into the world and record some audio. An excellent reason to take an impromptu camping trip! I took my recording setup and list of sounds to capture out into the world. Anything that I didn\u2019t feel had an appropriate sound in nature simply would get recorded as a voice-over (i.e. COMBO!) when I returned home from the trip.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/justmyfeet-300x219.png \"justmyfeet\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/justmyfeet.png)\n\n**[]()Editing your Audio \u2013 Audacity**\n\nWhen it comes to editing audio, there are few tools as powerful or as deceptively simple as [Audacity](http:\/\/audacity.sourceforge.net\/). I prefer to use it over proprietary software for a number of reasons.\n\n1. It doesn\u2019t watermark your audio clips.\n2. It\u2019s open source, so no limitations of clip size etc\n3. Being open source, I can talk about it pedagogically without worry of corporate bias\n4. It\u2019s dead simple to use, and there are some great plugins that come with it\n\nFor these and many other reasons, I\u2019ll be referring to Audacity many times throughout this article series. It allows for effortless one-click line-in recording (if you\u2019ve got the ports). This is exactly how I ended up importing the audio samples from my mini disk player. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I transfer them directly as digital files?\u201d, one would naturally ask. \u201cSony.\u201d, would be my reply. Their anti-consumer efforts did not begin with the Playstation 3, nor do they only extend do their gaming division. While you can transfer audio from your PC and record audio (even optically!) on mini disc players, you cannot transfer the files back to your PC. Seriously. You have to use a line-in cable. Next time I should just go with a reel-to-reel setup and save myself some hassle! Ha!\n\n**[]()Removing Ambient Noise with Audacity**\n\nOne of the best plugins that ships with Audacity is the noise removal plugin from Dominic Mazzoni. It\u2019s dead simple to use, and does a very excellent job of removing background and mechanical noise from your audio clips. I\u2019ve uploaded some small clips as mp3s to demonstrate the profound difference in quality between the original and the post-processed version. [Here](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/before-processing.mp3) is the original clip, and [here](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/post-processing.mp3)is the post-processed clip. Note the hissing and light background noise has been virtually eliminated from the source audio. It\u2019s actually quite an easy process.\n\n1. First, open up your audio clip in Audacity. [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/pre-processed-wav-150x150.png \"pre-processed-wav\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/pre-processed-wav.png)\n2. Select a small chunk of your audio clip that is only background noise. [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/select_some_noise-150x150.png \"select_some_noise\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/select_some_noise.png)\n3. Next, select Effects->Noise Removal. [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/select_noise_removal-150x150.png \"select_noise_removal\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/select_noise_removal.png)\n4. From within the Noise Removal Pane, select \u201cGet Noise Profile\u201d.\n5. Hit Ctrl-A to select the entire clip. [![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/ctrl-a-150x150.png \"ctrl-a\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/ctrl-a.png)\n6. Again, select Effects->Noise Removal\n7. Click \u2018OK\u2019. That\u2019s all.\n\n**[]()Recording a Title Theme with Audacity**\n\nAudacity is also a great tool for recording simple multi-track loops and vocals. As long as you\u2019ve got a mic plugged in and selected in the preferences, recording your theme song is as easy as pie.\n\n1. Record a small vocal. For my upcoming game \u20185 seconds\u2019 I recorded \u2018hurry hurry\u2019\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/audacity1-300x300.png \"audacity1\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/audacity1.png)\n\n3. Record the same vocal again, in a slightly different pitch\n4. Repeat a few times\n5. Add some supporting sounds (bass notes, harmonies)\n[![](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/audacity2-264x300.png \"audacity2\")](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/audacity2.png)\n\n7. That\u2019s that!\n\nStay tuned for more updates and sneak peeks at my newest game \u20185 Seconds\u2019.\n\n\n","html":"<p>This is the second in an article series about Android development, open source software, audio production, and so much more.

An excellent reason to take an impromptu camping trip!  I took my recording setup and list of sounds to capture out into the world.  Anything that I didn&#8217;t feel had an appropriate sound in nature simply would get recorded as a voice-over (i.e. COMBO!) when I returned home from the trip.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/justmyfeet.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/justmyfeet-300x219.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"justmyfeet\" width=\"300\" height=\"219\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3207\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/justmyfeet-300x219.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/justmyfeet-1024x749.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"a5\"><\/a>Editing your Audio &#8211; Audacity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When it comes to editing audio, there are few tools as powerful or as deceptively simple as <a href=\"http:\/\/audacity.sourceforge.net\/\">Audacity<\/a>. I prefer to use it over proprietary software for a number of reasons.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It doesn&#8217;t watermark your audio clips.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s open source, so no limitations of clip size etc<\/li>\n<li>Being open source, I can talk about it pedagogically without worry of corporate bias<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s dead simple to use, and there are some great plugins that come with it<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>For these and many other reasons, I&#8217;ll be referring to Audacity many times throughout this article series.  It allows for effortless one-click line-in recording (if you&#8217;ve got the ports).  This is exactly how I ended up importing the audio samples from my mini disk player.  &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t I transfer them directly as digital files?&#8221;, one would naturally ask.  &#8220;Sony.&#8221;, would be my reply.  Their anti-consumer efforts did not begin with the Playstation 3, nor do they only extend do their gaming division.  While you can transfer audio from your PC and record audio (even optically!) on mini disc players, you cannot transfer the files back to your PC.  Seriously.  You have to use a line-in cable.  Next time I should just go with a reel-to-reel setup and save myself some hassle!  Ha!<\/p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"a6\"><\/a>Removing Ambient Noise with Audacity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the best plugins that ships with Audacity is the noise removal plugin from Dominic Mazzoni. It&#8217;s dead simple to use, and does a very excellent job of removing background and mechanical noise from your audio clips. I&#8217;ve uploaded some small clips as mp3s to demonstrate the profound difference in quality between the original and the post-processed version. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/before-processing.mp3\">Here<\/a> is the original clip, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/post-processing.mp3\">here<\/a>is the post-processed clip. Note the hissing and light background noise has been virtually eliminated from the source audio.

As for using embedded Quick Grapher, just follow the guide below:\n\nHere\u2019s the Original Embedded Quick Grapher Tutorial :\n\n**A New Kind of Graphing Tool**  \n If you\u2019ve been using any of the betas at www.quickgrapher.com you may have found yourself wondering how it works, what libraries we use, and if the tech is available for public consumption. QuickGrapher is based on two of our pure Javascript libraries, our solver library and our graphing library. Due to the increased interest in these libraries, we\u2019ve bundled them both together into a single javascript library you can include on your site, which allows you unprecedented graphing power in a fully client-side javascript environment. You can display unlimited graphs with scores of points and complex equations faster than you ever thought possible, and without requiring your users to download a bandwidth-intensive image or flash applet. Our graph+solve library allows you to embed a graph of arbitrary algorithmic and point complexity using a single \u201cgraph\u201d tag, just like any other html tag. Our library is compatiblie with Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE, and even embedded browsers for your iPhone, Blackberry, and Android devices.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n<table><tr><td><graph equation1=\"3x+2y\" style=\"height:100px; width:150px; \" title=\"2Vars\" vars1=\"5,9\"><\/graph><\/td><td><graph equation1=\"2a-3b\" style=\"align:right; height:100px; width:150px; \" title=\"2More\" vars1=\"9,5\"><\/graph><\/td><td><graph equation1=\"tree-leaf\" minstepmax1=\"1,3,33;1,5,90\" style=\"height:100px; width:150px; float:left;position: relative; left: 0px;\" vars1=\"4,3\"><\/graph><\/td><td><graph label=\"awesome Points\" label2=\"awesome Line\" style=\"height:100px; width:150px; float:left;\" title=\"Point+Line\" type=\"point\" type2=\"line\" values=\"1,1;2,2;3,3;1,3;2,3\" values2=\"4,4;5,5;4,6;6,6\"><\/graph><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><graph label=\"awesome Points\" style=\"height:100px; width:150px;float:left;\" type=\"point\" values=\"1,1;2,2;3,3;1,3;2,3;1.5,1.5;3,3.3;2.123,4.33;5,5\"><\/graph><\/td><td><graph label1=\"awesome spots on a line\" style=\"height:100px; width:150px;position: relative; left: 0px;\" type1=\"line\" values1=\"1,1;2,2;3,3;1,3;2,3\"><\/graph><\/td><td><graph equation1=\"sin(x)\" label=\"awesome Points\" label2=\"awesome Line\" style=\"height:100px; width:150px;\" title=\"Point+Line+Eq\" type=\"point\" type2=\"line\" values=\"1,1;2,2;3,3;1,3;2,3\" values2=\"4,4;5,5;4,6;6,6\"><\/graph><\/td><td><graph equation1=\"3+x\" equation2=\"sin(f)\" minstepmax1=\"1,5,50\" style=\"height:100px; width:150px;\" title=\"Multi Eqs\" vars1=\"3\" vars2=\"5\"><\/graph><\/td><\/tr><\/table>**Seriously Easy**  \n Ok, so you\u2019re writing a post in your blog and you want to display your data on a graph. Maybe you\u2019re a huge corporation with thousands of employees, maybe you\u2019re an election enthusiast who wants to show some key demographic, or maybe you\u2019re just writing in your personal WordPress blog. You don\u2019t pay for application hosting, and even if you did you don\u2019t know or don\u2019t have the time to install a server process to generate graphs. Why should it be so complicated? Why can\u2019t you just do it with a single html tag?  \n Now you can. Graph+Solve allows you to instantly and easily insert graphs anywhere into your site. Fully stylable via CSS and HTML5 compliant, Graph+Solve allows any level of user from novice to web designer the power to visually display your data.\n\n**Example 1**  \n Say you\u2019re writing a blog post about trigonometry. Maybe you\u2019re an engineer, maybe you\u2019re a student, maybe you just like math. You\u2019re explaining sin and cos waves, and you\u2019d like to show their periodicity. You could use traditional methods (screenshots of math utilities, excel sheets, etc), or you could have it done in 5 second with Graph+Solve library. Graph+Solve allows you to graph sine, cosine, and many more functions in a single tag. The following tag is all that is required to generate a graph of cosine and sine.  \n<small><graph equation1=\u201dsin(x)\u201d equation2=\u201dcos(y)\u201d \/><\/small>  \n<graph equation1=\"sin(x)\" equation2=\"cos(y)\" minstepmax1=\"0,.01,30\" minstepmax2=\"0,.01,30\" title=\"Example Sine and Cosine Graph\"><\/graph>\n\n**Versatile Options**  \n Graph+Solve supports a wide range of options and CSS styles. Simply by setting the correct attributes one may use Graph+Solve to instantly create cross-platform maps and terrain graphs. Dimensions, colors, backgrounds, grids, legends and so much more can be easily set using standard html and css tag attributes. Perhaps you\u2019re not interested in a background grid, XY coordinates, multiple equations, legends, etc. Graph+Solve allows you to set exactly the options you care about, and can auto-generate any necessary attributes not specified by the user.\n\n**Example 2**  \n Say you\u2019re writing a blog post about military tactics. Maybe you\u2019re a soldier, maybe you\u2019re a history buff, maybe you just like tactics. You\u2019d like to show the positions of soldiers on a battlefield grid, and you don\u2019t want to have to continually edit maps by hand. With Graph+Solve, you can instantly share your strategies with no image editing. The following tag is all that is needed to generate the following graph.  \n<small><graph values=\u201d10,10;30,11;40,12;20,8;50,7;60,15;70,5;21,10;33,12;44,24;\u201d label=\u201dconfederate soldiers\u201d type=\u201dpoint\u201d values2=\u201d3,20;10,20;15,23;20,25;33,28;30,22;40,18;55,22;70,18\u2033 type2=\u201dpoint\u201d label2=\u201dunion soliders\u201d background=\u201dhttp:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/discursivelabs\/images\/3lakes.png\u201d title=\u201dBattle of The Three Lakes\u201d style=\u201dheight:400px; width:400px;\u201d\/><\/small>\n\n<graph background=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/discursivelabs\/images\/3lakes.png\" label=\"confederate soldiers\" label2=\"union soliders\" style=\"height:400px; width:400px;\" title=\"Battle of The Three Lakes\" type=\"point\" type2=\"point\" values=\"10,10;30,11;40,12;20,8;50,7;60,15;70,5;21,10;33,12;44,24;\" values2=\"3,20;10,20;15,23;20,25;33,28;30,22;40,18;55,22;70,18\"><\/graph>\n\n**Serious Bandwidth Reduction**  \n Our pure clientside Javascript graph+solve library in its entirety weighs in at 40 kilobytes. That\u2019s roughly equivalent to a very small, highly compressed jpeg from a camera phone circa 2005. With this one 40 kilobyte library (less than what adsense loads), you can replace every single graph or equation plot on your website. If you\u2019re running a graph heavy website this can be a reduction of many thousands of times. What\u2019s more, our graph+solve library is used by many websites, and may be cached by the users browser. If a user is coming in from another graph+solve enabled site, they download nothing. This is a serious reduction in page load times for all browsers, but especially for those on 3g networks or hampered by a slow connection.\n\n**Example 3**  \n Let\u2019s say you\u2019re writing an article on statistics, and you\u2019d like to show a random distribution. A really large random distribution would be best, as the more data the better visual. You could generate a million points using a programming language, then feed it into an existing tool such as excel or matlab. Then, using the same tool you could plot another guide line along the median to show where the mean distribution should be. That is, if you can figure out how to add a line to a plot graph. Or, you could do it in ten seconds in a single line of html using the Graph+Solve library. The following line of html generates a hundred random points and plots a line across the median of the graph. Note how you are able to style the graph using standard CSS tags, and simultaneously display line graphs, point graphs, and equation graphs using the same tag.  \n<small> <graph equation1=\u201drand(x)\u201d minstepmax1=\u201d0,10,1000\u2033 title=\u201dMean Random Distrubtion\u201d values1=\u201d1,.5;100,.5\u2033 label2=\u201dMedian Line\u201d type2=\u201dline\u201d\/><\/small>  \n  \n<graph equation1=\"rand(x)\" label2=\"Median Line\" minstepmax1=\"0,10,1000\" style=\"height:200px; width:600px;\" title=\"Mean Random Distrubtion\" type2=\"line\" values1=\"1,.5;100,.5\"><\/graph>\n\n**Serious Efficiency**  \n Just because graph+solve is executed by a client\u2019s browser, don\u2019t expect it to be slow. Graph+solve requires no external plugin of any kind, Flash or otherwise. It speedily graphs thousands of points in a few moments on a Pentium 3 class computer, quite ancient now in 2011. Graphs of complex equations with thousands of data points and complex algebraic functions load faster than a single equivalent image on mobile 3g devices.\n\n**Example 4**  \n So you\u2019re looking to plot a large number of data points in a graph, and you want it to be easy? Good luck! Unless you\u2019re using our Graph+Solve library, you are in for a headache. Find the data source, paste it into your graph generator, save it as an image, upload that image to your web host and align for your page. Need to update a single data point? You\u2019ve got to do it over. Want to change to a plot graph from a line graph? You\u2019ve got to do it over. What to update the graph styling, size, etc? You\u2019ve got to do it over. Want it to look good on all devices? Well you\u2019d better make a new image size for each device! Starting to get frustrated? Do it with a single line of QuickGrapher, update it whenver you like in moments, and never think of it again. The following two lines of html generate line graphs using points taken from an graphing calculator games worksheet. As you can see, switching between a point and a line graph is as simple as selecting \u201cpoint\u201d or \u201cline\u201d  \n<small>  \n <graph title=\u201dOur Mystery Point Graph\u201d values=\u201d20,11;19,6;19,2;17,2;17,6;16,5;15,2;13,2;14,5;14,6;12,6;12,2;10,2;10,4;9,2;7,2;9,6;7,6;4,4;2,3;0,2;1,3;3,5;5,9;9,11;17,11;21,17;23,18;25,17;24,16;20,11;\u201d label=\u201dMystery Points\u201d type=\u201dpoint\u201d style=\u201dwidth:250px;float:left;\u201d \/>   \n <graph title=\u201dNot A Mystery Anymore\u201d values=\u201d20,11;19,6;19,2;17,2;17,6;16,5;15,2;13,2;14,5;14,6;12,6;12,2;10,2;10,4;9,2;7,2;9,6;7,6;4,4;2,3;0,2;1,3;3,5;5,9;9,11;17,11;21,17;23,18;25,17;24,16;20,11;\u201d label=\u201dPoint Connecting Lines\u201d type=\u201dline\u201d style=\u201dwidth:250px;float:left;align:right;\u201d \/>   \n<\/small>\n\n<table><tr><td><graph label=\"Mystery Points\" style=\"width:250px;float:left;\" title=\"Our Mystery Point Graph\" type=\"point\" values=\"20,11;19,6;19,2;17,2;17,6;16,5;15,2;13,2;14,5;14,6;12,6;12,2;10,2;10,4;9,2;7,2;9,6;7,6;4,4;2,3;0,2;1,3;3,5;5,9;9,11;17,11;21,17;23,18;25,17;24,16;20,11;\"><\/graph><\/td><td><graph label=\"Point Connecting Lines\" style=\"width:250px;float:left;align:right;\" title=\"Not A Mystery Anymore\" type=\"line\" values=\"20,11;19,6;19,2;17,2;17,6;16,5;15,2;13,2;14,5;14,6;12,6;12,2;10,2;10,4;9,2;7,2;9,6;7,6;4,4;2,3;0,2;1,3;3,5;5,9;9,11;17,11;21,17;23,18;25,17;24,16;20,11;\"><\/graph><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\n","html":"<p>So you&#8217;ve seen the power of Quick Grapher and want to add it to your site?

This is a serious reduction in page load times for all browsers, but especially for those on 3g networks or hampered by a slow connection.\n      <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Example 3<\/strong><br \/>\n      Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re writing an article on statistics, and you&#8217;d like to show a random distribution.  A really large random distribution would be best, as the more data the better visual.  You could generate a million points using a programming language, then feed it into an existing tool such as excel or matlab.  Then, using the same tool you could plot another guide line along the median to show where the mean distribution should be. That is, if you can figure out how to add a line to a plot graph.  Or, you could do it in ten seconds in a single line of html using the Graph+Solve library.  The following line of html generates a hundred random points and plots a line across the median of the graph.  Note how you are able to style the graph using standard CSS tags, and simultaneously display line graphs, point graphs, and equation graphs using the same tag.<br \/>\n     <small> &lt;graph equation1=&#8221;rand(x)&#8221; minstepmax1=&#8221;0,10,1000&#8243; title=&#8221;Mean Random Distrubtion&#8221; values1=&#8221;1,.5;100,.5&#8243; label2=&#8221;Median Line&#8221; type2=&#8221;line&#8221;\/&gt;<\/small><br \/>\n      <br \/>\n      <graph equation1=\"rand(x)\" minstepmax1=\"0,10,1000\" title=\"Mean Random Distrubtion\" values1=\"1,.5;100,.5\" label2=\"Median Line\" type2=\"line\" style=\"height:200px; width:600px;\"\/>\n      <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Serious Efficiency<\/strong><br \/>\n      Just because graph+solve is executed by a client&#8217;s browser, don&#8217;t expect it to be slow.  Graph+solve requires no external plugin of any kind, Flash or otherwise.  It speedily graphs thousands of points in a few moments on a Pentium 3 class computer, quite ancient now in 2011.  Graphs of complex equations with thousands of data points and complex algebraic functions load faster than a single equivalent image on mobile 3g devices.\n      <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Example 4<\/strong><br \/>\n      So you&#8217;re looking to plot a large number of data points in a graph, and you want it to be easy?  Good luck!  Unless you&#8217;re using our Graph+Solve library, you are in for a headache.  Find the data source, paste it into your graph generator, save it as an image, upload that image to your web host and align for your page.  Need to update a single data point?  You&#8217;ve got to do it over.  Want to change to a plot graph from a line graph?  You&#8217;ve got to do it over.  What to update the graph styling, size, etc?  You&#8217;ve got to do it over.  Want it to look good on all devices?  Well you&#8217;d better make a new image size for each device!  Starting to get frustrated?  Do it with a single line of QuickGrapher, update it whenver you like in moments, and never think of it again.  The following two lines of html generate line graphs using points taken from an graphing calculator games worksheet.  As you can see, switching between a point and a line graph is as simple as selecting &#8220;point&#8221; or &#8220;line&#8221;<br \/>\n      <small><br \/>\n       &lt;graph title=&#8221;Our Mystery Point Graph&#8221; values=&#8221;20,11;19,6;19,2;17,2;17,6;16,5;15,2;13,2;14,5;14,6;12,6;12,2;10,2;10,4;9,2;7,2;9,6;7,6;4,4;2,3;0,2;1,3;3,5;5,9;9,11;17,11;21,17;23,18;25,17;24,16;20,11;&#8221; label=&#8221;Mystery Points&#8221; type=&#8221;point&#8221; style=&#8221;width:250px;float:left;&#8221; \/&gt; <br \/>\n       &lt;graph title=&#8221;Not A Mystery Anymore&#8221; values=&#8221;20,11;19,6;19,2;17,2;17,6;16,5;15,2;13,2;14,5;14,6;12,6;12,2;10,2;10,4;9,2;7,2;9,6;7,6;4,4;2,3;0,2;1,3;3,5;5,9;9,11;17,11;21,17;23,18;25,17;24,16;20,11;&#8221; label=&#8221;Point Connecting Lines&#8221; type=&#8221;line&#8221; style=&#8221;width:250px;float:left;align:right;&#8221;  \/&gt; <br \/>\n          <\/small>        <\/p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><graph title=\"Our Mystery Point Graph\" values=\"20,11;19,6;19,2;17,2;17,6;16,5;15,2;13,2;14,5;14,6;12,6;12,2;10,2;10,4;9,2;7,2;9,6;7,6;4,4;2,3;0,2;1,3;3,5;5,9;9,11;17,11;21,17;23,18;25,17;24,16;20,11;\" label=\"Mystery Points\" type=\"point\" style=\"width:250px;float:left;\" \/>  <\/td>\n<td> <graph title=\"Not A Mystery Anymore\" values=\"20,11;19,6;19,2;17,2;17,6;16,5;15,2;13,2;14,5;14,6;12,6;12,2;10,2;10,4;9,2;7,2;9,6;7,6;4,4;2,3;0,2;1,3;3,5;5,9;9,11;17,11;21,17;23,18;25,17;24,16;20,11;\" label=\"Point Connecting Lines\" type=\"line\" style=\"width:250px;float:left;align:right;\" \/> <\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 23 Dec 2012 18:30:27 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 23 Dec 2012 18:32:20 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 23 Dec 2012 18:30:27 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":3473,"title":"Project Updates: ASLJS on GitHub Pages, QuickGrapher is Back!, QuickGrapher Graphs Anywhere On HunterDavis.com (Even Comments!)","slug":"project-updates-asljs-on-github-pages-quickgrapher-is-back-quickgrapher-graphs-anywhere-on-hunterdavis-com-even-comments","markdown":"\nI\u2019ve been working on a skeletal animation\/game programming article for a little while now, and it has prompted me to update some of my other projects.

One excellent open source library that compliments Android\u2019s view pager design is [ViewPagerIndicator](https:\/\/github.com\/JakeWharton\/Android-ViewPagerIndicator) by Jake Wharton. It provides a tabbed visual indicator of where your user is in a flow of screens, has recently added a nice IconPagerIndicator, and is [all the rage](http:\/\/viewpagerindicator.com\/).\n\nI\u2019ll be using it to create a Game Select screen for the [5 Seconds](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/FiveSeconds) minigame collection. Right now 5 Seconds consists of a combination of OpenGL and non-OpenGL games, and everything is highly compartmentalized with their own title screens and credits, theme music, etc. As such, a view pager (with a nice view pager indicator to provide some visual context) is a perfect UI paradigm for the game select screen.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll want to include the [ViewPagerIndicator library](https:\/\/github.com\/JakeWharton\/Android-ViewPagerIndicator\/) from GitHub into your project as a library project.\n\n**[Creating your Activity]()**  \n Your main activity in a view pager layout is essentially a skeleton which holds your top level references. As such, it can be fairly simple. This looks like:  \n```\n<br><\/br>\n\/\/ The game select screen is the main 'hub' of 5 seconds```\n\n\/**  \n * The Class GameSelectScreen.  \n *\/  \n public class GameSelectScreen extends FragmentActivity {  \n \/*  \n * (non-Javadoc)  \n *  \n * @see android.app.Activity#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)  \n *\/  \n @Override  \n public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {  \n super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);  \n setContentView(R.layout.activity_game_select_screen);  \n }\n\n \/*  \n * (non-Javadoc)  \n *  \n * @see android.app.Activity#onCreateOptionsMenu(android.view.Menu)  \n *\/  \n @Override  \n public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {  \n getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.activity_game_select_screen, menu);  \n return true;  \n }  \n }\n\nAs you can see there\u2019s not much too it. We\u2019ll add in the instantiation of our fragments and pagers later, after we\u2019ve created the UI layouts.\n\n**[UI Layouts and Unobtrusive Advertising]()**  \n We\u2019ll need two main layouts, one for the game select screen, and a generic one for each of the individual game screens. For your main game select screen you\u2019ll need a standard View Pager from the Android support library, and a View Pager Indicator from the ViewPagerIndicator library. The code for 5 seconds game select screen looks like:\n\n`<br><\/br><linearlayout android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:orientation=\"vertical\" xmlns:android=\"http:\/\/schemas.android.com\/apk\/res\/android\"><\/linearlayout>`\n\n<com.viewpagerindicator.tabpageindicator android:id=\"@+id\/gameSelectTitlePageIndicator\" android:layout_height=\"100dp\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"><\/com.viewpagerindicator.tabpageindicator>  \n<android.support.v4.view.viewpager android:id=\"@+id\/gameSelectPager\" android:layout_height=\"0dp\" android:layout_weight=\"1\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"><\/android.support.v4.view.viewpager>\n\nFor the generic layout that can be inflated for each of the games, you\u2019ll want a large display area for the game title screen icon. If you are using advertising, you also may want to include it on this screen rather than on any of the game screens (seems like people are starting to hate in-game advertisement, but a menu advertisement feels like a fair compromise). This looks like:\n\n[![pop them baloons with adverts front screen](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/pop-them-baloons-with-adverts-front-screen-180x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/pop-them-baloons-with-adverts-front-screen.png)\n\nAnd the code is simply:  \n`<br><\/br><?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"??><br><\/br><linearlayout android:layout_height=\"match_parent\" android:layout_width=\"match_parent\" android:orientation=\"vertical\" xmlns:ads=\"http:\/\/schemas.android.com\/apk\/lib\/com.google.ads\" xmlns:android=\"http:\/\/schemas.android.com\/apk\/res\/android\"><\/linearlayout>`\n\n<imagebutton android:id=\"@+id\/gameTitleImage\" android:layout_height=\"0dip\" android:layout_weight=\"1\" android:layout_width=\"match_parent\" android:scaletype=\"fitXY\" android:src=\"@android:drawable\/btn_dialog\"><\/imagebutton>\n\n<com.google.ads.adview ads:adsize=\"BANNER\" ads:adunitid=\"a150df41144503a\" ads:loadadoncreate=\"true\" android:id=\"@+id\/adView\" android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"><\/com.google.ads.adview>\n\n**[Creating your Generic Fragment with Saving and Loading of State Values]()**  \n You\u2019ll need a Fragment class which can create fragment instances and inflate your game select screens. For a game select screen these fragments really only need to have four sets of basic functionality:\n\n1. It must be able to generate instances of itself to return to the top level view pager\n2. It should save and load its instance state using standard android lifecycle methods\n3. It should display the game title screen image\n4. It should allow you to click on the title screen image and load that activity\n\nYou can see below what the code looks like for 5 seconds. Note the use of Bundles during creation and onSaveInstanceState. This allows the system to restore the fragment to its previous state regardless of whether the android system dropped it out of memory.\n\n```\n<br><\/br>\npackage com.hunterdavis.fiveseconds.ui;```\n\nimport android.os.Bundle;  \n import android.support.v4.app.Fragment;  \n import android.view.LayoutInflater;  \n import android.view.View;  \n import android.view.ViewGroup;  \n import android.widget.ImageButton;\n\npublic class GameSelectScreenFragment extends Fragment {  \n private static final String KEY_TITLE = \"GameSelectScreen:Title\";  \n private static final String KEY_IMAGE = \"GameSelectScreen:Image\";\n\n private String mTitle = \"\";  \n private int mTitleImage = -1;  \n private View.OnClickListener mTitleOnClickListener;\n\n public static GameSelectScreenFragment newInstance(String title,  \n int titleImageResource, View.OnClickListener onClick) {  \n GameSelectScreenFragment gameSelectFragment = new GameSelectScreenFragment();  \n gameSelectFragment.mTitle = title;  \n gameSelectFragment.mTitleImage = titleImageResource;  \n gameSelectFragment.mTitleOnClickListener = onClick;\n\n return gameSelectFragment;  \n }\n\n @Override  \n public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {  \n super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n\n if (savedInstanceState != null) {  \n if (savedInstanceState.containsKey(KEY_TITLE)) {  \n mTitle = savedInstanceState.getString(KEY_TITLE);  \n }  \n if (savedInstanceState.containsKey(KEY_IMAGE)) {  \n mTitleImage = savedInstanceState.getInt(KEY_IMAGE);  \n mTitleOnClickListener = GameSelectScreenResources  \n .getOnClickListenerForIcon(mTitleImage);  \n }  \n }  \n }\n\n @Override  \n public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,  \n Bundle savedInstanceState) {  \n View gameTitleLayout = inflater  \n .inflate(  \n com.hunterdavis.fiveseconds.R.layout.generic_game_title_fragment,  \n null);\n\n \/\/ set our title image and onclick if we've got em  \n if (mTitleImage > -1) {  \n ImageButton gameTitleView = (ImageButton) gameTitleLayout  \n .findViewById(com.hunterdavis.fiveseconds.R.id.gameTitleImage);  \n gameTitleView.setImageDrawable(getResources().getDrawable(  \n mTitleImage));  \n if (mTitleOnClickListener != null) {  \n gameTitleView.setOnClickListener(mTitleOnClickListener);  \n }  \n }  \n return gameTitleLayout;  \n }\n\n @Override  \n public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {  \n super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);  \n outState.putString(KEY_TITLE, mTitle);  \n outState.putInt(KEY_IMAGE, mTitleImage);  \n }  \n }\n\n**[Creating Your Adapter]()**  \n Now that you\u2019ve got a generic fragment and a layout to inflate, you\u2019ll need an adapter for the view pager which also handles the icon pager indicator. There is an excellent base example available in the ViewPagerIndicator library to get you started. You can see below how it turned out for 5 seconds. Note the use of a static method in a **GameSelectScreenResources** class to get the onClick method for a particular image. This allows us to grab the onClick for an image from other classes without instantiating an instance of the GameSelectFragmentAdapter. While the default example from Jake Wharton\u2019s library keeps these resource constant values within the fragment adapter, in practice they are easily moved out to another class. I find having all the resources and their helper functions de-coupled from the fragment adapter helps to keep the game Selection metadata localized to one location.\n\n```\n<br><\/br>\npublic class GameSelectFragmentAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter implements<br><\/br>\n\t\tIconPagerAdapter {```\n\n private int mCount = GameSelectScreenResources.GAMETITLES.length;\n\n public GameSelectFragmentAdapter(FragmentManager fm) {  \n super(fm);  \n }\n\n @Override  \n public GameSelectScreenFragment getItem(int position) {  \n int screen = GameSelectScreenResources.GAMESCREENS[position % GameSelectScreenResources.GAMEICONS.length];  \n return GameSelectScreenFragment.newInstance(GameSelectScreenResources.GAMETITLES[position  \n % GameSelectScreenResources.GAMETITLES.length], screen,  \n GameSelectScreenResources.getOnClickListenerForGameScreen(screen));  \n }\n\n @Override  \n public int getCount() {  \n return mCount;  \n }\n\n @Override  \n public CharSequence getPageTitle(int position) {  \n return \"\";  \n }\n\n public CharSequence getTitleForPageAtPosition(int position) {  \n return GameSelectScreenResources.GAMETITLES[position  \n % GameSelectScreenResources.GAMETITLES.length];  \n }\n\n @Override  \n public int getIconResId(int index) {  \n return GameSelectScreenResources.GAMEICONS[index % GameSelectScreenResources.GAMEICONS.length];  \n }\n\n public void setCount(int count) {  \n if (count > 0 && count\n\nAnd here's the GameSelectScreenResources class:\n\n```\n<br><\/br>\npublic class GameSelectScreenResources {<br><\/br>\n\tpublic static final String[] GAMETITLES = new String[] {<br><\/br>\n\t\t\"Pop Them Baloons\", \"...Jump\", \"Title Screen\", \"Credits Screen\",<br><\/br>\n\t\t\"About the Author\" };<br><\/br>\n\tpublic static final int[] GAMEICONS = new int[] {<br><\/br>\n\t\tR.drawable.popxcolorbaloonsicon, R.drawable.jumpscreenicon,<br><\/br>\n\t\tR.drawable.fivesecondstitleicon, R.drawable.creditsicon,<br><\/br>\n\t\tR.drawable.abouttheauthoricon };```\n\n public static final int[] GAMESCREENS = new int[] {  \n R.drawable.popxcolorbaloonstitle, R.drawable.jumptitle,  \n R.drawable.fivesecondstitle, R.drawable.creditstitle,  \n R.drawable.abouttheauthor };\n\n public static OnClickListener getOnClickListenerForGameScreen(int icon) {  \n switch (icon) {  \n case R.drawable.popxcolorbaloonstitle: \/* Pop X Color Baloons *\/  \n return new OnClickListener() {  \n @Override  \n public void onClick(View v) {  \n PopXColorBalloons.startPopXColorBaloonsScreen(  \n v.getContext(), 3 + (new Random().nextInt(2)));  \n }  \n };  \n case R.drawable.jumptitle: \/* dotdotdotjump *\/  \n return new OnClickListener() {  \n @Override  \n public void onClick(View v) {  \n DotDotDotJump.startDotDotDotJumpScreen(v.getContext(), 1);  \n }  \n };  \n case R.drawable.fivesecondstitle: \/* Title Screen *\/  \n return new OnClickListener() {  \n @Override  \n public void onClick(View v) {  \n }  \n };  \n case R.drawable.creditsicon: \/* Credits Screen *\/  \n return new OnClickListener() {  \n @Override  \n public void onClick(View v) {  \n }  \n };  \n case R.drawable.abouttheauthor: \/* about the author *\/  \n return new OnClickListener() {  \n @Override  \n public void onClick(View v) {  \n }  \n };  \n default:  \n return new OnClickListener() {  \n @Override  \n public void onClick(View v) {  \n }  \n };  \n }  \n }  \n }\n\n**[Putting it all Together - Instantiation]()**  \n Remember how empty our top level game select screen activity was? It's now time to fill that in. Not to worry, as we'll only need to add some instantiation around our view pager and view pager indicator. First, add some member variables to hold the pagers.\n\n```\n<br><\/br>\n\t\/\/ view pager members<br><\/br>\n\tandroid.support.v4.view.ViewPager mPager;<br><\/br>\n\tTabPageIndicator mIndicator;<br><\/br>\n        GameSelectFragmentAdapter mAdapter;<br><\/br>```\n\nNext, instantiate them in the onCreate method.\n\n```\n<br><\/br>\n\t@Override<br><\/br>\n\tpublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {<br><\/br>\n\t\tsuper.onCreate(savedInstanceState);```\n\n setContentView(R.layout.activity_game_select_screen);\n\n mAdapter = new GameSelectFragmentAdapter(getSupportFragmentManager());\n\n mPager = (android.support.v4.view.ViewPager)findViewById(R.id.gameSelectPager);  \n mPager.setAdapter(mAdapter);\n\n mIndicator = (TabPageIndicator )findViewById(R.id.gameSelectTitlePageIndicator);  \n mIndicator.setViewPager(mPager);\n\n }\n\n**[Icing On the Cake - Title Music Loading]()**\n\nNow that you've got your view pager and icon-enabled view pager indicator working, why not add a little pizzazz to your game select screen? Adding an onChange listener to play each game's title screen music during selection is as simple as:\n\n1. Adding an onChangeListener callback to your view pager. Start with an anonymous implementation like:  \n```\n<br><\/br>\n        mIndicator.setOnPageChangeListener(new OnPageChangeListener() {<p>\t\t\t@Override<br><\/br>\n\t\t\tpublic void onPageSelected(int arg0) {<\/p><p>\t\t\t}<\/p><p>\t\t\t@Override<br><\/br>\n\t\t\tpublic void onPageScrolled(int arg0, float arg1, int arg2) {<\/p><p>\t\t\t}<\/p><p>\t\t\t@Override<br><\/br>\n\t\t\tpublic void onPageScrollStateChanged(int arg0) {<\/p><p>\t\t\t}<br><\/br>\n\t\t});<br><\/br><\/p>```\n2. Add a static method to your GameSelectScreenResources class which can provide the correct music ID. For 5 seconds the code is:  \n```\n<br><\/br>\n\tpublic static final int[] GAMETITLEMUSIC = new int[] {<br><\/br>\n\t\t\tR.raw.popxcolorballoonstitletheme, R.raw.compressedtitletheme,<br><\/br>\n\t\t\tR.raw.compressedtitletheme, R.raw.fivesecondscredits,<br><\/br>\n\t\t\tR.raw.popxcolorballoonscreditstheme };<p>\tpublic static int getMusicForPageAtPosition(int position) {<br><\/br>\n\t\treturn GAMETITLEMUSIC[position % GAMETITLEMUSIC.length];<br><\/br>\n\t}<br><\/br><\/p>```\n3. Creating a method for your onPageSelected callback to play music based on which page was selected. For music playback, I use a reference to a class level Easy Audio Manager instance. The code for this is simply:  \n```\n<br><\/br>\n\t\/** The audio manager. *\/<br><\/br>\n\tEasyAudioManager audioManager;<p>\tpublic void playGameThemeMusic(Context context, int pageId) {<br><\/br>\n\t\tif (audioManager == null) {<br><\/br>\n\t\t\t\/\/ create the audioManager<br><\/br>\n\t\t\taudioManager = new EasyAudioManager(this, null);<br><\/br>\n\t\t}<br><\/br>\n\t\tif (audioManager.songPlaying) {<br><\/br>\n\t\t\taudioManager.pauseSong();<br><\/br>\n\t\t}<br><\/br>\n\t\taudioManager.setSong(<br><\/br>\n\t\t\t\tcontext,<br><\/br>\n\t\t\t\tGameSelectScreenResources.getMusicForPageAtPosition(pageId<br><\/br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t% GameSelectScreenResources.GAMETITLEMUSIC.length));<br><\/br>\n\t\taudioManager.playSong();<br><\/br>\n\t}<br><\/br><\/p>```\n\n**[Conclusion]()**  \n And that's that! Now you've got a nice implementation of a game select screen, and a great starting point for adding all sorts of polish to your game select.

This allows the system to restore the fragment to its previous state regardless of whether the android system dropped it out of memory.<\/p>\n<p><code><br \/>\npackage com.hunterdavis.fiveseconds.ui;<\/p>\n<p>import android.os.Bundle;<br \/>\nimport android.support.v4.app.Fragment;<br \/>\nimport android.view.LayoutInflater;<br \/>\nimport android.view.View;<br \/>\nimport android.view.ViewGroup;<br \/>\nimport android.widget.ImageButton;<\/p>\n<p>public class GameSelectScreenFragment extends Fragment {<br \/>\n\tprivate static final String KEY_TITLE = \"GameSelectScreen:Title\";<br \/>\n\tprivate static final String KEY_IMAGE = \"GameSelectScreen:Image\";<\/p>\n<p>\tprivate String mTitle = \"\";<br \/>\n\tprivate int mTitleImage = -1;<br \/>\n\tprivate View.OnClickListener mTitleOnClickListener;<\/p>\n<p>\tpublic static GameSelectScreenFragment newInstance(String title,<br \/>\n\t\t\tint titleImageResource, View.OnClickListener onClick) {<br \/>\n\t\tGameSelectScreenFragment gameSelectFragment = new GameSelectScreenFragment();<br \/>\n\t\tgameSelectFragment.mTitle = title;<br \/>\n\t\tgameSelectFragment.mTitleImage = titleImageResource;<br \/>\n\t\tgameSelectFragment.mTitleOnClickListener = onClick;<\/p>\n<p>\t\treturn gameSelectFragment;<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t@Override<br \/>\n\tpublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {<br \/>\n\t\tsuper.onCreate(savedInstanceState);<\/p>\n<p>\t\tif (savedInstanceState != null) {<br \/>\n\t\t\tif (savedInstanceState.containsKey(KEY_TITLE)) {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tmTitle = savedInstanceState.getString(KEY_TITLE);<br \/>\n\t\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\t\tif (savedInstanceState.containsKey(KEY_IMAGE)) {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tmTitleImage = savedInstanceState.getInt(KEY_IMAGE);<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tmTitleOnClickListener = GameSelectScreenResources<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.getOnClickListenerForIcon(mTitleImage);<br \/>\n\t\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\t}<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t@Override<br \/>\n\tpublic View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,<br \/>\n\t\t\tBundle savedInstanceState) {<br \/>\n\t\tView gameTitleLayout = inflater<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t.inflate(<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcom.hunterdavis.fiveseconds.R.layout.generic_game_title_fragment,<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnull);<\/p>\n<p>\t\t\/\/ set our title image and onclick if we've got em<br \/>\n\t\tif (mTitleImage > -1) {<br \/>\n\t\t\tImageButton gameTitleView = (ImageButton) gameTitleLayout<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t.findViewById(com.hunterdavis.fiveseconds.R.id.gameTitleImage);<br \/>\n\t\t\tgameTitleView.setImageDrawable(getResources().getDrawable(<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\tmTitleImage));<br \/>\n\t\t\tif (mTitleOnClickListener != null) {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tgameTitleView.setOnClickListener(mTitleOnClickListener);<br \/>\n\t\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\treturn gameTitleLayout;<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t@Override<br \/>\n\tpublic void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {<br \/>\n\t\tsuper.onSaveInstanceState(outState);<br \/>\n\t\toutState.putString(KEY_TITLE, mTitle);<br \/>\n\t\toutState.putInt(KEY_IMAGE, mTitleImage);<br \/>\n\t}<br \/>\n}<br \/>\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"a4\">Creating Your Adapter<\/a><\/strong><br \/>\nNow that you&#8217;ve got a generic fragment and a layout to inflate, you&#8217;ll need an adapter for the view pager which also handles the icon pager indicator.  There is an excellent base example available in the ViewPagerIndicator library to get you started.  You can see below how it turned out for 5 seconds.  Note the use of a static method in a <strong>GameSelectScreenResources<\/strong> class to get the onClick method for a particular image.  This allows us to grab the onClick for an image from other classes without instantiating an instance of the GameSelectFragmentAdapter.  While the default example from Jake Wharton&#8217;s library keeps these resource constant values within the fragment adapter, in practice they are easily moved out to another class.  I find having all the resources and their helper functions de-coupled from the fragment adapter helps to keep the game Selection metadata localized to one location.<\/p>\n<p><code><br \/>\npublic class GameSelectFragmentAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter implements<br \/>\n\t\tIconPagerAdapter {<\/p>\n<p>\tprivate int mCount = GameSelectScreenResources.GAMETITLES.length;<\/p>\n<p>\tpublic GameSelectFragmentAdapter(FragmentManager fm) {<br \/>\n\t\tsuper(fm);<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t@Override<br \/>\n\tpublic GameSelectScreenFragment getItem(int position) {<br \/>\n\t\tint screen = GameSelectScreenResources.GAMESCREENS[position % GameSelectScreenResources.GAMEICONS.length];<br \/>\n\t\treturn GameSelectScreenFragment.newInstance(GameSelectScreenResources.GAMETITLES[position<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t% GameSelectScreenResources.GAMETITLES.length], screen,<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tGameSelectScreenResources.getOnClickListenerForGameScreen(screen));<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t@Override<br \/>\n\tpublic int getCount() {<br \/>\n\t\treturn mCount;<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t@Override<br \/>\n\tpublic CharSequence getPageTitle(int position) {<br \/>\n\t\treturn \"\";<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\tpublic CharSequence getTitleForPageAtPosition(int position) {<br \/>\n\t\treturn GameSelectScreenResources.GAMETITLES[position<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t% GameSelectScreenResources.GAMETITLES.length];<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t@Override<br \/>\n\tpublic int getIconResId(int index) {<br \/>\n\t\treturn GameSelectScreenResources.GAMEICONS[index % GameSelectScreenResources.GAMEICONS.length];<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\tpublic void setCount(int count) {<br \/>\n\t\tif (count > 0 && count <= 10) {\n\t\t\tmCount = count;\n\t\t\tnotifyDataSetChanged();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t\n}\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p>And here's the GameSelectScreenResources class:<\/p>\n<p><code><br \/>\npublic class GameSelectScreenResources {<br \/>\n\tpublic static final String[] GAMETITLES = new String[] {<br \/>\n\t\t\"Pop Them Baloons\", \"...Jump\", \"Title Screen\", \"Credits Screen\",<br \/>\n\t\t\"About the Author\" };<br \/>\n\tpublic static final int[] GAMEICONS = new int[] {<br \/>\n\t\tR.drawable.popxcolorbaloonsicon, R.drawable.jumpscreenicon,<br \/>\n\t\tR.drawable.fivesecondstitleicon, R.drawable.creditsicon,<br \/>\n\t\tR.drawable.abouttheauthoricon };<\/p>\n<p>\tpublic static final int[] GAMESCREENS = new int[] {<br \/>\n\t\tR.drawable.popxcolorbaloonstitle, R.drawable.jumptitle,<br \/>\n\t\tR.drawable.fivesecondstitle, R.drawable.creditstitle,<br \/>\n\t\tR.drawable.abouttheauthor };<\/p>\n<p>\tpublic static OnClickListener getOnClickListenerForGameScreen(int icon) {<br \/>\n\t\tswitch (icon) {<br \/>\n\t\tcase R.drawable.popxcolorbaloonstitle: \/* Pop X Color Baloons *\/<br \/>\n\t\t\treturn new OnClickListener() {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t@Override<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tpublic void onClick(View v) {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\tPopXColorBalloons.startPopXColorBaloonsScreen(<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tv.getContext(), 3 + (new Random().nextInt(2)));<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\t\t};<br \/>\n\t\tcase R.drawable.jumptitle: \/* dotdotdotjump *\/<br \/>\n\t\t\treturn new OnClickListener() {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t@Override<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tpublic void onClick(View v) {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\tDotDotDotJump.startDotDotDotJumpScreen(v.getContext(), 1);<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\t\t};<br \/>\n\t\tcase R.drawable.fivesecondstitle: \/* Title Screen *\/<br \/>\n\t\t\treturn new OnClickListener() {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t@Override<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tpublic void onClick(View v) {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\t\t};<br \/>\n\t\tcase R.drawable.creditsicon: \/* Credits Screen *\/<br \/>\n\t\t\treturn new OnClickListener() {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t@Override<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tpublic void onClick(View v) {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\t\t};<br \/>\n\t\tcase R.drawable.abouttheauthor: \/* about the author *\/<br \/>\n\t\t\treturn new OnClickListener() {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t@Override<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tpublic void onClick(View v) {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\t\t};<br \/>\n\t\tdefault:<br \/>\n\t\t\treturn new OnClickListener() {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t@Override<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tpublic void onClick(View v) {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\t\t};<br \/>\n\t\t}<br \/>\n\t}<br \/>\n}<br \/>\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"a5\">Putting it all Together - Instantiation<\/a><\/strong><br \/>\nRemember how empty our top level game select screen activity was?  It's now time to fill that in.  Not to worry, as we'll only need to add some instantiation around our view pager and view pager indicator.  First, add some member variables to hold the pagers.<\/p>\n<p><code><br \/>\n\t\/\/ view pager members<br \/>\n\tandroid.support.v4.view.ViewPager mPager;<br \/>\n\tTabPageIndicator mIndicator;<br \/>\n        GameSelectFragmentAdapter mAdapter;<br \/>\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Next, instantiate them in the onCreate method.<\/p>\n<p><code><br \/>\n\t@Override<br \/>\n\tpublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {<br \/>\n\t\tsuper.onCreate(savedInstanceState);<\/p>\n<p>\t\tsetContentView(R.layout.activity_game_select_screen);<\/p>\n<p>\t\tmAdapter = new GameSelectFragmentAdapter(getSupportFragmentManager());<\/p>\n<p>                mPager = (android.support.v4.view.ViewPager)findViewById(R.id.gameSelectPager);<br \/>\n                mPager.setAdapter(mAdapter);<\/p>\n<p>                mIndicator = (TabPageIndicator )findViewById(R.id.gameSelectTitlePageIndicator);<br \/>\n                mIndicator.setViewPager(mPager);<\/p>\n<p>\t}<br \/>\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"a6\">Icing On the Cake - Title Music Loading<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now that you've got your view pager and icon-enabled view pager indicator working, why not add a little pizzazz to your game select screen?  Adding an onChange listener to play each game's title screen music during selection is as simple as:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Adding an onChangeListener callback to your view pager.  Start with an anonymous implementation like:<br \/>\n<code><br \/>\n        mIndicator.setOnPageChangeListener(new OnPageChangeListener() {<\/p>\n<p>\t\t\t@Override<br \/>\n\t\t\tpublic void onPageSelected(int arg0) {<\/p>\n<p>\t\t\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t\t\t@Override<br \/>\n\t\t\tpublic void onPageScrolled(int arg0, float arg1, int arg2) {<\/p>\n<p>\t\t\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t\t\t@Override<br \/>\n\t\t\tpublic void onPageScrollStateChanged(int arg0) {<\/p>\n<p>\t\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\t});<br \/>\n<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Add a static method to your GameSelectScreenResources class which can provide the correct music ID.  For 5 seconds the code is:<br \/>\n<code><br \/>\n\tpublic static final int[] GAMETITLEMUSIC = new int[] {<br \/>\n\t\t\tR.raw.popxcolorballoonstitletheme, R.raw.compressedtitletheme,<br \/>\n\t\t\tR.raw.compressedtitletheme, R.raw.fivesecondscredits,<br \/>\n\t\t\tR.raw.popxcolorballoonscreditstheme };<\/p>\n<p>\tpublic static int getMusicForPageAtPosition(int position) {<br \/>\n\t\treturn GAMETITLEMUSIC[position % GAMETITLEMUSIC.length];<br \/>\n\t}<br \/>\n<\/code> <\/li>\n<li>Creating a method for your onPageSelected callback to play music based on which page was selected.  For music playback, I use a reference to a class level Easy Audio Manager instance.  The code for this is simply:<br \/>\n<code><br \/>\n\t\/** The audio manager. *\/<br \/>\n\tEasyAudioManager audioManager;<\/p>\n<p>\tpublic void playGameThemeMusic(Context context, int pageId) {<br \/>\n\t\tif (audioManager == null) {<br \/>\n\t\t\t\/\/ create the audioManager<br \/>\n\t\t\taudioManager = new EasyAudioManager(this, null);<br \/>\n\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\tif (audioManager.songPlaying) {<br \/>\n\t\t\taudioManager.pauseSong();<br \/>\n\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\taudioManager.setSong(<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tcontext,<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tGameSelectScreenResources.getMusicForPageAtPosition(pageId<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t% GameSelectScreenResources.GAMETITLEMUSIC.length));<br \/>\n\t\taudioManager.playSong();<br \/>\n\t}<br \/>\n<\/code> <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><a name=\"a7\">Conclusion<\/a><\/strong><br \/>\nAnd that's that!

I responded to every one.\n- During 2012 I received 15 total emails for feature requests, I implemented 8 of them.\n- Since becoming a Play store developer in May 2011, I have published 68 apps. I have pulled one app and had one app suspended due to DMCA request by Atari (custom pong.)\n- All of my apps have crashed a total of 63 times. That\u2019s less than one crash per year per app on average.\n- The #1 most downloaded app is \u2018[Easy Cat Whistle](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.easycatwhistle&hl=en)\u2018 with 48K, followed by \u2018[Easy Pest Control](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.easypestcontrol)\u2018 with 17k, and a three way tie with \u2018[Easy Side by Side](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.easysidebyside)\u2018, \u2018[Easy Graph Paper](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.easygraphpaper)\u2018, and \u2018[Easy File Split and Join](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.easyfilesplitandjoin)\u2018 each having about 10-11k.\n- The app with the most active installs is \u2018[Easy Side by Side](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.easysidebyside)\u2018 with 3860, followed by \u2018[Easy Cat Whistle](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.easycatwhistle&hl=en)\u2018 with 3459 and \u2018[Easy Inventory](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.easyinventory)\u2018 with 2629\n- The average rating for one of my apps is 3.6 (out of 5). The average number of people who actually rate an app is ten.\n- My one paid app ([Super Whistle](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.superwhistle)) took about two hours to complete and has been purchased 53 times, netting me ~40$\n- I make about 50$ monthly on in-app advertising during the summer months, and 100$ during the winter months (this is not captured in this document, only through my bank statements).

Do note however, that most of these apps haven\u2019t been updated since I initially published them in 2011, and advertising revenue continues to slowly rise.

One useful technique to have in your bag of tricks is that of basic skeletal animation. In this article series, I\u2019ll run you though the basics of 2-d skeletal animation. I\u2019ll be implementing this as part of a variant of the popular \u2018run as far as you can\u2019 games on the Android platform using [AndEngine](http:\/\/www.andengine.org\/)\/OpenGL as the rendering back-end. Those more interested in reading code can follow along at the [5 Seconds GitHub commit history](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/FiveSeconds\/commits\/master). At the end of this series, you\u2019ll be able to implement basic skeletal animation in the language of your choice. I\u2019ll be using Android\/Java\/*OpenGL as the pedagogical example, but the code should port easily to other platforms.\n\n*Note that if you\u2019re following along in code, you\u2019ll see the original game engine was a basic multi-threaded game loop\/render loop combo I created for this article series (any 5-seconds games using OpenGL would inherit from [these base classes I cooked up](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/AndroidEasyGameUtils)). \u00a0After a few months of some [awesome project](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2013\/01\/08\/rhapsody-ford-sync-debuts-ces-today\/)s at work taking up my time, I switched it out to [andEngine](http:\/\/www.andengine.org\/). \u00a0That said I\u2019ll still be running through a bit of basic engine design. \u00a0If you\u2019re looking to get a feel for basic Android game programming without the OpenGL and much of the multi-threaded bits, I\u2019d recommend reading through the source code of the \u2018Pop X Color Balloons\u2019 game contained within the project. As always, you can try the code out at anytime on your own Android device because everything about it is [open sourced on GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/FiveSeconds). Eventually I\u2019ll make this game series available on the Play store as a compilation game (think Wario-Ware), Until then, [GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/FiveSeconds) will be the place to grab the project.\n\nSkip Ahead:  \n[Let\u2019s Talk about \u201cBoundage\u201d  \n](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/?p=3426\/#a0) [Prequel: Choosing your Draw Ordering, and The Importance of The Separation Between Game Logic and Game Graphics  \n](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/?p=3426\/#a1) [Ensuring Thread Concurrency and Avoiding Deadlocks  \n](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/?p=3426\/#aa) [Baby Steps: Step One: Start with an Arm is an Arm is a Leg?  \n](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/?p=3426\/#a2) [Baby Steps: Step Two: Now Form The Head  \n](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/?p=3426\/#a3) [Some Thoughts On Procrastination](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/?p=3426\/#a4)\n\n\u00a0\n\n**[]()Let\u2019s Talk about \u201cBoundage\u201d**\n\nFor me, it all starts with an off-the-cuff sketch on paper.

When it\u2019s time for coding, you\u2019ll know it.\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td>[![page1](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/page17-231x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/page17.png)<\/td><td>[![page2](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/page2-300x259.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/page2.png)<\/td><td>[![page3](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/page3-251x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/page3.png)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>  \n How then, to convert your sketches from visual to mathematical principals? One useful technique is to think about the movement of your skeleton one part at a time. A problem is often easier to solve when you group its components logically. For humanoid movement (i.e. running), you can think of each discreet movement as a series of orientation changes occurring from the base of the part to the end of the part along that parts axis. Calculating the new position can be as simple as iterating a variable over a sin function. Remembering your basic geometry formulas (SOHCAHTOA) will help greatly in the mathematics. I find that drawing a bounding box around your part sketch helps greatly in the translation between form and function. You can design the size and movement of the part (i.e. the length and swinging of an arm or leg) relative to the size of the box (i.e. your arm is 9\/20 the length of your body). When it\u2019s time to write the code to draw each individual part you can simply reference the relative size and position of the bounding box you want the part drawn in and not have to worry about scaling texture assets to your screen\u2019s resolution. Now that you\u2019ve got a good feel for the basic skeletal motion, let\u2019s get down to some implementation specifics.\n\n**[]()Prequel: Choosing your Draw Ordering, and The Importance of The Separation Between Game Logic and Game Graphics**\n\nWhen constructing a basic skeletal model in code, you\u2019ll want to think of the view perspective the user will be viewing your model from. From the view perspective of the user, (mentally) draw an invisible line to infinity through your model. The order in which the line hits the parts is your reverse draw order. So for a \u2018running man\u2019 model in 2-dimensions, the user will first see the right arm and right leg and hair, followed by the head and body, and lastly the left arm and left leg. So your draw order is the reverse. If you\u2019re hand-rolling your graphics generation code, your draw function will first draw the left leg and left arm, followed by the body and head, followed by the hair, right arm, and right leg. You\u2019ll notice that in the drawings the position of the left arm is calculated based on the position of the body. This is where good separation of components comes into play. If your game engine tries to do double duty and updated the position of objects during your graphics thread you may run into trouble. No, not trouble in the sense that multi-core processors are the norm, and without multi-threading you\u2019re probabbly wasting a lot of that power. This is a design concern (at least for purely 2-d games). Remember that the player sees the left arm last, so it should be drawn first. If you\u2019re not animating in 3d (where a z-depth makes this point irrelevant) the calculations to draw the left arm become much more complex because of the relative positioning of the arm. You would have to first calculate the position of the body, (and cache that value for later use) then use the body\u2019s position to calculate the position of the left arm. As a conscientious game designer, your game engine separates the game updates from the graphics updates and allows you to calculate the position of objects in whatever fashion is most efficient (or easiest to understand, i.e. for readability).\n\n***[Ensuring Thread Concurrency and Avoiding Deadlocks]()***\n\nAs this is a game engine, we\u2019ll want each piece of data that is used by multiple threads to be thread-safe and synchronized over the smallest portion of code possible. The fewer \u2018locks\u2019 your threads have to go through to execute a piece of code the better. While CPU locks only take 17ns to unlock, a thread in a wait cycle could wait for milliseconds!. Just be careful with your race conditions and make sure you are locking over the final shared data item, not any functions used to calculate this item. (i.e. only synchronize class functions which are pure getters and setters.) For more complex functions be sure that you synchronize the final product, not any intermediate or thread-local data items. For body parts you\u2019ll generally be calculating a couple of XYZ position tuplets. Here\u2019s an example [tuplet ](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/AndroidEasyGameUtils\/blob\/master\/src\/com\/hunterdavis\/gameutils\/glrendering\/XYZTuple.java) class from my [game utilities](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/AndroidEasyGameUtils) library. You\u2019ll note that it has synchronized get and set functions, so it\u2019s thread safe. This does not mean however, that you don\u2019t have to be safe and think about your thread synchronization carefully. Consider the basic example of a set of functions which get and set the start and end values of an upper arm segment. Here is the function to get the thread safe tuplets:\n\n`public synchronized XYZTuple getUpperLimbEnd() { return mUpperLimbEnd; } `\n\nAnd here is a thread safe function to set that data:\n\n`public synchronized void setUpperLimbEnd(XYZTuple upperLimbEnd);\u00a0`\n\nThe above functions presented are thread safe, in that the data contained therein will not be read while it is being written to. Unfortunately that does not mean you cannot use them in a thread unsafe way. Consider the case of a drawing thread reading the values, and a game engine thread generating them. If the game engine thread updates the end value immediately after the drawing thread reads from the start value, the drawn segment will be incorrect. Over a very large model, this kind of thread concurrency issue could lead to visual artifacts, with lines jutting out of nowhere or warped textures. A more sensible set of functionality would be to store and return the values as a pair in a synchronized method as show below. While you will lose some time initially during creation, you\u2019ll save an additional function call each time you get the data and help prevent thread sync problems.\n\n`public synchronized void setLowerLimbPosition(Pair<xyztuple xyztuple=\"\"> startToEnd) { mUpperLimbStartToEnd = startToEnd; } <\/xyztuple>`\n\nAlways remember that thread synchronization (in Java) works over the class level. Knowing this, we can plan our abstractions such that highly entwined data (such as the start and end points of a line) can be surrounded by a thread safe mutex (such as the \u2018synchronized\u2019 keyword in Java). With a little forethought, you can synchronize your threads at the right level of abstraction and prevent (some) nasty graphical bugs from occurring. Be warned, use thread synchronized methods only when absolutely necessary (i.e. protect data items.) Synchronization locks steal precious execution time from your code, and bugs that occur in parallel logic can be orders of magnitude more complex than for single threaded programs.\n\n****[]()Baby Steps: Step One: Start with an Arm is an Arm is a Leg?**\u00a0**\n\nWhen generating your skeletal model, consider the logical abstractions you\u2019ll use. For a humanoid, it\u2019s likely that your arms and legs are constructed in a relatively similar manner. Each arm has an upper section, lower section, and hand. Likewise the leg has an upper section, lower section, and foot. Both arms and legs can therefore be represented by the same abstract \u2018limb\u2019 data structure, and we\u2019ll save ourselves some code duplication. While it may seem a bit of overkill to implement a full set of OOP structures to represent the body parts, it\u2019ll pay off when we get to game implementation.\n\n****[]()Baby Steps: Step Two: Now Form The Head****\n\nLike Voltron before us, now that we\u2019ve got the body, arms, and legs put together it\u2019s time to logically form the head. We generate our neck and face based on the uppermost position of the body, as well as a size we calculate based on the overall bounding box size. \u00a0That rounds out our logical abstractions for our skeletal model. \u00a0Next time, we\u2019ll actually animate that skeleton, and I\u2019ll talk about some tips and tricks you can apply to your animation to bring it up to production quality (hair, anyone?). \u00a0*Hashtags 3D and faux-3d, skinning, \u201cfaking\u201d and dynamic textures *(can you just say \u201chashtags\u201d? \u00a0\u2026 whatever.)\n\n***[]()Some Thoughts On Procrastination***\n\nThose of you who have been following along with the GitHub repository know that about 3\/4 of the way through writing this article I stopped updating. Nothing happened for 3 solid months on an article that was original just a weekend write-up. Why? There are many reasons, certainly I was busy at work and at home, but I think at the end of the day it boils down to procrastination, and a (perhaps not so) profound statement about programmers:\n\n*Sometimes, Code Duplication is Procrastination *\n\nDoes this happen to you? It took a while before I realized the pattern I myself was falling into. Every time I started a game project, I\u2019d implement some abstract game logic and the basis for the game, then spend a great deal of time re-implementing graphics functions that [perfectly good open source game engines](http:\/\/www.andengine.org\/) implemented long ago. At the end of the day hand-rolling all my shaders, openGL calls, texture caching, etc is just code duplication. One pro:tip I can give:\n\n*Unless you\u2019re writing an API,\u00a0don\u2019t write convenience methods for use cases that don\u2019t exist yet.*\n\nUnlike my [Audio Manager](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/Android_Simple_Game_Audio) library, I can\u2019t claim to bring anything more to the table (in terms of implementation, or content) than the authors of these engines. Likewise, for pedagogical reasons it makes more sense for me to use a library which is likely to be most useful to my audience, and have the longest shelf-life. (Note that while I DO have a mobile Unity developer license, I prefer to use open source software). \u00a0At any rate, I found myself falling into this common trap yet again when working on \u2026Jump. When I picked the project and this article back up recently, I decided to scrap the openGL work that I had written, swallow my \u201cpride\u201d, and switch to [AndEngine](http:\/\/www.andengine.org\/).\n\nAnd you know what? *It\u2019s not bad!* The GLES2 branch runs fine in an emulator. I had a basic scene set up in just a few minutes. My existing logical abstractions still hold. In the end, the vast majority of the first article was still relevant without revision. In terms of integration with existing code there hasn\u2019t been any issue with my game selection logic, title or credit screen logic, or audio manager library. Even better, it means that future articles in the series can be dropped into your production AndEngine code without any hassle, or even used as the basis for your first AndEngine game. \u00a0Who knows, perhaps I\u2019ll even try out it\u2019s audio manager classes. Stranger things have happened!\n\n\n","html":"<p>Textures are heavy. Bloat-y. They weigh down your apps, and consume memory. Sometimes you just want to efficiently animate something procedurally.

It consists of soy milk, chocolate coffee powder, and ice blended till smooth.\n\nThis meal breaks down into:\n\n1. The powder, which is manufactured by \u2018Innovative Beverage Concepts\u2019, a company with no public stock. I buy it at \u2018Cash and Carry\u2019, which is owned by \u2018Smart & Final\u2019, which is owned by Apollo Global Management, NYSE: APO . Current price, 26$\n2. The soy milk (Silk), which is owned by Dean Foods, Inc. NYSE: DF. Current price, 18.93\n3. The ice comes from my refrigerator, which came with the apartment. If I were purchasing the fridge new I\u2019d likely go with another manufacturer, so I\u2019ll hold off on purchasing any stock till that day comes.\n\n**Work:**\n\nMost of the purchasing decisions at my place of business are made by the head of IT and various business stakeholders. I do, however, have great latitude on the type of phone service plan used for my personal work phone. As I recently switched to Sprint, that breakdown is:\n\n1. Sprint, which is traded as NYSE:S, currently at 7.12\n\n**Daily Intake**\n\nDuring the course of a work week, I generally will grab a sports drink on my way into the office 3-4 times per week. This is almost always a Powerade, which is manufactured by the Coca Cola company. One of my coworkers also hit me up for a coffee, and being in Seattle, Starbucks was the destination of choice. A latte sure sounds like a different (though no less delicious) value proposition when there\u2019s a 60$ prerequisite stock purchase required for it.\n\n1. Coca Cola NYSE:KO, currently at 42.09.\n2. Starbucks, NASDAQ: SBUX, 60.00\n\nAdditionally,\n\n**Activity April 30th:**\n\nAfter work is over, I like to kick back and play some games through Steam on my personal laptop. It\u2019s a Dell machine, with an Intel chipset and Nvidia graphics. As each of these brands were choices I directly made when purchasing my laptop, they each went onto the \u2018buy\u2019 list.\n\n1. Dell, which is traded as NASDAQ:DELL, currently at 13.35\n2. Intel, which is traded as NASDAQ:INTC, currently at 23.4\n3. Nvidia, which is traded as NASDAQ: NVDA, currently at 13.66\n\nI am already starting to see a change in my investing behavior. Before this OPY expiriment,\n\n> Until this week, I would NEVER have bought stock in Nvidia, Coca Cola, or Intel.\n\n These three companies have a reputation for screwing over consumers with bad drivers, bad hardware, and in Coke\u2019s case out-and-out racism. While I can\u2019t speak to the latter, I have been personally burned by the former any number of times.\n\n> These companies are \u2018evil\u2019. Why then, do I continue to purchase their products?\n\nIn the case of Intel and Nvidia, there is one obvious solution: switch to AMD. And I\u2019ve thought about it, but at the end of the day I use those extra MHZ in my core-i7 and the native CUDA support new Nvidia chipsets provide.\n\nAs for Coke, I could easily switch to tap water from Powerade. I just prefer the taste of my \u2018power pool water\u2019.\n\n> I could, with a minimum of effort, switch away from these \u2018evil\u2019 corporations\u2026 but I don\u2019t.\n\nThere is obviously more to the picture. And let\u2019s face it, unless you\u2019re a high-roller in the market, investing isn\u2019t about emotional attachment and personal beliefs. It\u2019s about investment. Making money. Owning a part of a corporation that knows how to make money, and knows how to keep consumers coming back.\n\n**Activity May 1st**\n\nAs it\u2019s my birthday, I\u2019m not likely to spend any money today. Although I\u2019m likely grab a coffee later, I already own stock in Starbucks so I\u2019m covered on that front.\n\nThat does bring up an interesting side-effect that I have noticed during the first days of OPY. By only purchasing items from corporations in which I own a part, I change the economics of choice greatly. A purchasing choice once made becomes easier to purchase again. All future purchases from that company come without a stock purchase attached.\n\n> I am effectively rewarding myself for brand loyalty.\n\n Is this a good thing? I have no idea, but it\u2019s an interesting experience.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Though it was a couple days before the official kick-off, I went ahead and started the investing week early.

It consists of soy milk, chocolate coffee powder, and ice blended till smooth.  <\/p>\n<p>This meal breaks down into:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The powder, which is manufactured by &#8216;Innovative Beverage Concepts&#8217;, a company with no public stock.  I buy it at &#8216;Cash and Carry&#8217;, which is owned by &#8216;Smart &#038; Final&#8217;, which is owned by Apollo Global Management, NYSE: APO .  Current price, 26$<\/li>\n<li>The soy milk (Silk), which is owned by Dean Foods, Inc. NYSE: DF.  Current price, 18.93<\/li>\n<li>The ice comes from my refrigerator, which came with the apartment.  If I were purchasing the fridge new I&#8217;d likely go with another manufacturer, so I&#8217;ll hold off on purchasing any stock till that day comes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Work:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most of the purchasing decisions at my place of business are made by the head of IT and various business stakeholders.  I do, however, have great latitude on the type of phone service plan used for my personal work phone.  As I recently switched to Sprint, that breakdown is:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sprint, which is traded as NYSE:S, currently at 7.12<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Daily Intake<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>During the course of a work week, I generally will grab a sports drink on my way into the office 3-4 times per week.  This is almost always a Powerade, which is manufactured by the Coca Cola company.  One of my coworkers also hit me up for a coffee, and being in Seattle, Starbucks was the destination of choice.  A latte sure sounds like a different (though no less delicious) value proposition when there&#8217;s a 60$ prerequisite stock purchase required for it.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Coca Cola NYSE:KO, currently at 42.09.<\/li>\n<li>Starbucks, NASDAQ: SBUX, 60.00<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Additionally, <\/p>\n<p><strong>Activity April 30th:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After work is over, I like to kick back and play some games through Steam on my personal laptop.  It&#8217;s a Dell machine, with an Intel chipset and Nvidia graphics.  As each of these brands were choices I directly made when purchasing my laptop, they each went onto the &#8216;buy&#8217; list.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dell, which is traded as NASDAQ:DELL, currently at 13.35<\/li>\n<li>Intel, which is traded as NASDAQ:INTC, currently at 23.4<\/li>\n<li>Nvidia, which is traded as NASDAQ: NVDA, currently at 13.66<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I am already starting to see a change in my investing behavior.  Before this OPY expiriment, <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Until this week, I would NEVER have bought stock in Nvidia, Coca Cola, or Intel.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>  These three companies have a reputation for screwing over consumers with bad drivers, bad hardware, and in Coke&#8217;s case out-and-out racism.  While I can&#8217;t speak to the latter, I have been personally burned by the former any number of times.  <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>These companies are &#8216;evil&#8217;.  Why then, do I continue to purchase their products?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case of Intel and Nvidia, there is one obvious solution: switch to AMD.  And I&#8217;ve thought about it, but at the end of the day I use those extra MHZ in my core-i7 and the native CUDA support new Nvidia chipsets provide.<\/p>\n<p>As for Coke, I could easily switch to tap water from Powerade.  I just prefer the taste of my &#8216;power pool water&#8217;.  <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I could, with a minimum of effort, switch away from these &#8216;evil&#8217; corporations&#8230; but I don&#8217;t.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There is obviously more to the picture.  And let&#8217;s face it, unless you&#8217;re a high-roller in the market, investing isn&#8217;t about emotional attachment and personal beliefs.  It&#8217;s about investment.  Making money.  Owning a part of a corporation that knows how to make money, and knows how to keep consumers coming back.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Activity May 1st<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As it&#8217;s my birthday, I&#8217;m not likely to spend any money today. Although  I&#8217;m likely grab a coffee later, I already own stock in Starbucks so I&#8217;m covered on that front.<\/p>\n<p>That does bring up an interesting side-effect that I have noticed during the first days of OPY.  By only purchasing items from corporations in which I own a part, I change the economics of choice greatly.  A purchasing choice once made becomes easier to purchase again. All future purchases from that company come without a stock purchase attached. <\/p>\n<blockquote><p> I am effectively rewarding myself for brand loyalty.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>  Is this a good thing?  I have no idea, but it&#8217;s an interesting experience. <\/p>\n<\/ol>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Wed, 01 May 2013 15:53:58 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 01 May 2013 15:54:43 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 01 May 2013 15:53:58 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":3886,"title":"Only Pay Yourself: Throwing Common Sense Out The Window","slug":"only-pay-yourself-throwing-common-sense-out-the-window","markdown":"\nDuring the first week in May, I considered myself quite thrifty.

I realized that it\u2019s been over a dozen years since my last game review, so it seemed the right time for an update.\n\n> I\u2019ve been catching up on some of the games on my \u201cgaming bucket list\u201d.\n\nRead on for my short reviews of: Tomb Raider, Bioshock Infinite, Injustice: Gods Among Us, Metroid Fusion, Darksiders 2, God of War: Ascension, Luigi\u2019s Mansion, Super Mario 3D Land, Sly Cooper, PlayStation All Stars: Battle Royale, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (10th anniversary Android Edition), Brutal Legend, and Super Amazing Wagon Adventure.\n\n**Tomb Raider**  \n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?t=wwwhunterdavi-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B004FS8LYK&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\"><\/iframe>\n\n*Tomb Raider*: Now that it\u2019s under 20$, there\u2019s no reason not to buy this game. It\u2019s very similar to Uncharted, but with an RPG leveling system bolted on top. The weapons level up as well. It\u2019s an experience game, as in \u2018you should experience this game\u2019. The production quality is top notch and the sheer amount of effort that must have gone into making it is evident throughout. The story-line was pretty gripping, and many times I was brought back to those days of my youth spent playing tomb raider on PS1.\n\n**Bioshock Infinite**  \n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?t=wwwhunterdavi-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B009SPZ11Q&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\"><\/iframe>\n\n*Bioshock Infinite*: Sad as it is to say, I picked up this game and spent about 2 hours playing before I moved on to other games and kind of forgot about it. The scenery is gorgeous, but the initial pacing is pretty slow, even for a Bioshock game. The story is interesting but not particularly in-depth. I\u2019ve already seen about 10 racist things happen in the game, so it\u2019s definitely not one you should play anywhere near young children. For that reason alone it\u2019ll probably take me a while to beat this one. Bottom line: It is good enough to keep me coming back to finish it, but not good enough to keep me from playing more interesting games as they come along. Definitely pick it up if it drops to the 15-20$ range.\n\n**Injustice: Gods Among Us**  \n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?t=wwwhunterdavi-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B0088I7KYU&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\"><\/iframe>\n\n*Injustice: Gods Among Us*: I could not stop playing this game. The most enjoyable fighting game I\u2019ve played in years. If you were a fan of the Justice League or Teen Titans animate series you will love this game. All the old voice cast is there (both Justice League and Teen Titans). I became completely engrossed in the single player story mode, and spent about 8 hours straight playing through it. It\u2019s very much like playing through an extended DC animated movie. I simply could not stop playing (and I was playing on hard mode, which is quite challenging). If you\u2019ve got folks to play multi-player with (or a low-latency connection to play online) I\u2019d recommend picking this up, otherwise rent it. If it drops below 20$, pick it up. I could definitely see myself replaying through this one a few times.\n\n**Metroid Fusion**  \n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?t=wwwhunterdavi-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B00006M3R6&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\"><\/iframe>  \n*Metroid Fusion*: OK, people criticize this game because it\u2019s \u2018too linear\u2019. You know what else is linear? A movie. This game felt (to me) like Metroid Prime 3. Sure, it\u2019s linear, but it\u2019s also paced. The backtracking is minimal. The storyline and interaction with your AI commanding officer keeps the dialog feeling fresh and interesting, even to veterans of the Metroid series. I picked this up for 15$ at my local classic games store. It\u2019s a great way to break in your [Retrode GBA adapter](https:\/\/www.retrode.com\/store?lang=en), and the controls feel great with a SNES controller.\n\n**Darksiders 2**  \n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?t=wwwhunterdavi-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B0056WJA30&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\"><\/iframe>  \n*Darksiders 2*: You can often find this game for 5-10$. Pick it up while you still can. They won\u2019t be making more. It\u2019s like the God of War series, but with more enemies on screen ala the Dynasty Warriors series. The plot is (to me), much more enjoyable as well, featuring a mix of christian and pagan mythology, rather than another re-hashed Greek myth like the GOW series. It\u2019s pretty dark, and definitely not something you can play around kids. Still, for the price that it\u2019s at now it\u2019s a definite buy.\n\n**God of War: Ascension**  \n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?t=wwwhunterdavi-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B007TYC8MI&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\"><\/iframe>  \n*God of War: Ascension*. Gross, yawn, woah, gross, yawn, done. That\u2019s my experience playing the first 4 hours of GOW:Ascension. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little gross-out, and it\u2019s certainly not out of character for the GOW series, that\u2019s the problem. Nothing in this game is out of character for the GOW series. You start off with so many powers and weapons you already feel like you\u2019ve been leveling up through a game\u2019s worth of GOW, and it all feels done before. Worse still, it\u2019s a prequel for a game that we all played almost 10 years ago, then re-played again 2 years ago. So story-line wise it doesn\u2019t answer any questions or raise any new ideas. For the cost, it just doesn\u2019t seem worth it. Maybe pick it up if it ever hits bargain basement status (which it surely will if review scores are any indication). For now, rent it if you are curious.\n\n**Luigi\u2019s Mansion**  \n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?t=wwwhunterdavi-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B0053BCP40&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\"><\/iframe>  \n*Luigi\u2019s Mansion*: I played through the Gamecube version again in preparation for this game. There are some marked differences, but in many ways they are improvements. The ghosts are no longer styled like real people, but rather in a cartoon-like style. I imagine it was done to decrease the overall creepiness level of the Gamecube version, which at times could be a dark, potentially child-terrifying, game. This feels like something you could play with your 8 year old. The controls have been simplified slightly, and it\u2019s all the better for it. I played through on my 3DS XL and it looked great. I can\u2019t speak for those on the smaller 3DS, but the visuals appeared crisp and detailed. The addition of extra mansions helped prevent the feeling of backtracking that plagued the previous game. If you\u2019re a fan of the original, pick this up now. I purchased this during the \u2018get Super Mario 3D Land free!\u2019 promotion, and am certainly happy with the deal. Casual fans will probably enjoy it as well, but you can probably find it for 30$ if you wait a couple months.\n\n<stroing>Super Mario 3D Land  \n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=wwwhunterdavi-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=B002I092MM\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\"><\/iframe>  \n*Super Mario 3D Land*: For the 40$ they are asking for this game, you\u2019d be better served finding a used copy of New Super Mario Brothers for 15$. If you\u2019re getting this game for free or in a BOGO deal (like ToysRUs are always running), then it\u2019s quite an enjoyable game. The return of the flying leaf\/raccoon suit is fun but doesn\u2019t feel like anything new. It still doesn\u2019t recreate the fun of flying you first had when you played Super Mario World (though Super Mario Galaxy comes very close). After you play through all of the levels, you find out there are a second set of levels to be played through with Luigi. Lots of copy-paste levels though. For ~20$ this is a great game with a lot of content. It\u2019s all about the price point on this one. <\/stroing>\n\n**Sly Cooper**  \n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?t=wwwhunterdavi-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B0050SXU3Q&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\"><\/iframe>  \n*Sly Cooper*: Fans of the original should pick this up right away. Those with children who like to watch them play or help play along in less difficult parts should pick this up right away. Those who have never played, imagine a cross between Mario and Assassin\u2019s Creed. You\u2019re a sneaky raccoon thief with a fun assortment of animal pals helping you steal back artifacts in gorgeous cartoon levels. I\u2019ve seen this at 30$ for the PS3 and it\u2019s well worth it. I recently picked it up for 20$ on the Vita and I\u2019m very impressed with how well the visuals stand up to the PS3 version. Very fun, very well produced, and very well worth the bargain price.\n\n**PlayStation All Stars: Battle Royale**  \n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?t=wwwhunterdavi-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B002I0GZHW&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\"><\/iframe>  \n*PlayStation All Stars: Battle Royale*: Dear Sony,\n\nWant to know why this game is selling horribly? It\u2019s not for lack of characters (though that\u2019s what you certainly seem to think it is), *it\u2019s for lack of innovation*. Everything about this game screams \u2018RIP OFF\u2019. You even aped smash brothers\u2019 shitty camera. Really? Ugh. Even getting a free vita version when you buy the PS3 version isn\u2019t enough to make this a \u2018buy\u2019. Two shitty games for one full price is still paying half price for the same shitty game, two times. The worst part is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019d take much to fix this game. Give us some new gameplay modes (have you even played Battlestation DON?) and a lot more interaction with the background elements. Throw in some more varied match types, and tack on some RPG elements to keep us invested. I couldn\u2019t even make it through a single play-through in single player mode and I was stuck on a plane. It just all feels like it\u2019s been done before, about 10 years ago, about 10 times better.\n\n**Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (10th anniversary Android Edition)**  \n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?t=wwwhunterdavi-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B00008JODN&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\"><\/iframe>  \n*Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (10th anniversary Android Edition)*: It\u2019s not San Andreas, but it\u2019ll do for now. It looks and plays gorgeously on my Nook HD+ tablet, and the radio stations take me back to another time. A great buy for a 5$ and certainly worth it for those long plane rides. I spent a 6 hour flight from DC to Seattle just cruising around Vice City in a series of motorcycles, doing stunts and missions, feeling like it was old times.\n\n**Brutal Legend**  \n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=wwwhunterdavi-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=B00BIMSDR6\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\"><\/iframe>  \n*Brutal Legend*: I pre-ordered this on Steam at full price, having already purchased it for the 360 what seems like an eternity ago (4 years). I never played it, but always meant to (and was way into Psychonauts, purchasing it every time it came out on a new platform). Prediction: psychonauts will come out for android within a year. At any rate, I enjoyed playing through Brutal Legend quite a bit. The soundtrack is AWESOME. It\u2019s full of metal greats and really adds to the experience. Crank up the volume when playing this one. Seeing as how it\u2019s now available for 10$ or so, it\u2019s a definite purchase. I spent about 25 or so hours before completing it, and certainly felt like I could have spent about twice that going through all the optional missions. A must own for metal-heads and Tim Schafer fans alike.\n\n> Prediction: psychonauts will come out for android within a year.\n\n**Super Amazing Wagon Adventure**  \n[![steamworkshop_collection_1346990471_collection_branding](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/steamworkshop_collection_1346990471_collection_branding.png)](http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=94482719)  \n*Super Amazing Wagon Adventure*: ARRGGGGHHH WHY CAN\u2019T I BEAT THIS GAME??

The plot is (to me), much more enjoyable as well, featuring a mix of christian and pagan mythology, rather than another re-hashed Greek myth like the GOW series. It&#8217;s pretty dark, and definitely not something you can play around kids.  Still, for the price that it&#8217;s at now it&#8217;s a definite buy.   <\/p>\n<p><strong>God of War: Ascension<\/strong><br \/>\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?t=wwwhunterdavi-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as1&#038;asins=B007TYC8MI&#038;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&#038;fc1=000000&#038;IS2=1&#038;lt1=_blank&#038;m=amazon&#038;lc1=0000FF&#038;bc1=000000&#038;bg1=FFFFFF&#038;f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<em>God of War: Ascension<\/em>.

Nothing in this game is out of character for the GOW series.  You start off with so many powers and weapons you already feel like you&#8217;ve been leveling up through a game&#8217;s worth of GOW, and it all feels done before.  Worse still, it&#8217;s a prequel for a game that we all played almost 10 years ago, then re-played again 2 years ago.  So story-line wise it doesn&#8217;t answer any questions or raise any new ideas.  For the cost, it just doesn&#8217;t seem worth it.  Maybe pick it up if it ever hits bargain basement status (which it surely will if review scores are any indication).  For now, rent it if you are curious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Luigi&#8217;s Mansion<\/strong><br \/>\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/rcm.amazon.com\/e\/cm?t=wwwhunterdavi-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as1&#038;asins=B0053BCP40&#038;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&#038;fc1=000000&#038;IS2=1&#038;lt1=_blank&#038;m=amazon&#038;lc1=0000FF&#038;bc1=000000&#038;bg1=FFFFFF&#038;f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<em>Luigi&#8217;s Mansion<\/em>:  I played through the Gamecube version again in preparation for this game.  There are some marked differences, but in many ways they are improvements.  The ghosts are no longer styled like real people, but rather in a cartoon-like style.  I imagine it was done to decrease the overall creepiness level of the Gamecube version, which at times could be a dark, potentially child-terrifying, game.  This feels like something you could play with your 8 year old.  The controls have been simplified slightly, and it&#8217;s all the better for it.  I played through on my 3DS XL and it looked great.  I can&#8217;t speak for those on the smaller 3DS, but the visuals appeared crisp and detailed.  The addition of extra mansions helped prevent the feeling of backtracking that plagued the previous game.  If you&#8217;re a fan of the original, pick this up now.  I purchased this during the &#8216;get Super Mario 3D Land free!&#8217; promotion, and am certainly happy with the deal.

The return of the flying leaf\/raccoon suit is fun but doesn&#8217;t feel like anything new.  It still doesn&#8217;t recreate the fun of flying you first had when you played Super Mario World (though Super Mario Galaxy comes very close).  After you play through all of the levels, you find out there are a second set of levels to be played through with Luigi.  Lots of copy-paste levels though.

Birthdays\n2. Photos\n3. Personal Advertising\n4. Sharing with \u201cThose Who Only Use Facebook\u201d\n5. Keeping in Touch\n\nI want to move away from Facebook, but I don\u2019t want to lose out on the above perks of having a \u201csocial\u201d network. I put social in quotes because Facebook has ceased to be a means to socialize. The signal to noise ratio is too high. People use their cell phones to txt or email any immediate information, and the sharing of photos has started to migrate to other sites (sites with less draconian business practices). \u201cMoving Away From Facebook\u201d has become a popular topic, and this trend will only continue. After 8 years of daily usage there\u2019s no easy way to do this, so I figure it\u2019s better to rip it off like a bandage and remove it completely.\n\nHere\u2019s how I\u2019m moving away from Facebook: replace each of the above items. I believe that it can be done, without much difficulty. The first step is getting your data out of Facebook. Luckily, nowadays they make this rather easy for you. You can move away from Facebook, and your life will be better for it.\n\n> You *can* move away from Facebook, and your life will be better for it.\n\n**Birthdays**\n\nFor birthdays, Facebook allows you [export all of your birthday data](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/206619532710687\/) as a calendar you can import on your iCal or Google Calendar (or [open source calendar](https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/?fromgroups#!forum\/jquery-week-calendar)). So now you won\u2019t need to log into Facebook to check whose birthday is coming up.\n\n**Photos**\n\nPhotos are a difficult problem. On the one hand, it\u2019s very easy to post your photo up to Facebook from your phone. On the other hand, who knows how that photo will be used, and who will eventually end up looking at it. Yeah, maybe a second cousin once removed is considered a family member, but do you really want anyone who uses their computer to be able to browse photos of your 8 year old\u2019s recital? Where does it end? We are just now realizing as a society that the ubiquitous surveillance that comes from social media may be depriving our youth of their ability to be young and reckless. It\u2019s certainly depriving us of a shared sense of privacy, and often dignity. Remember when the pain of looking at boring vacation photos was a trope brought up in movies and television? When did that change? When our cell phones became our cameras, did our vacations become inherently more interesting? Maybe we\u2019re all just paying less attention, with our second and third screens ever vying for our wandering eyes?\n\n> When our cell phones became our cameras, did our vacations become inherently more interesting?\n\nAt any rate, there are many competing services for photo hosting. I personally recommend allowing multiple competing services (Box, DropBox, Google) to back up all your photos for you. They all have facilities for sharing or emailing photos, and you\u2019ll sleep better at night knowing the creepy big data teams at Facebook aren\u2019t using your photos to learn something about your purchasing behavior.\n\nHere\u2019s the quick-start guide to getting photo data out of Facebook,\n\n1. Back up all your Facebook photos that you\u2019ve previously updated. You can do this in [one fell swoop](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/131112897028467\/) directly from Facebook.\n2. Download all the photos that you\u2019ve been tagged in. [PhotoGrabber ](https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/photograbber\/downloads\/list)is a great piece of software to accomplish this.\n3. Set up a replacement photo backup service on your phone. DropBox and Box both have fine products to accomplish this, both of which have apps that set up the process for you and don\u2019t mine your data for facial heuristics.\n\n**Personal Advertising**\n\nOne of the main reasons I keep my Facebook account is as an avenue to promote my apps\/games\/products\/blog posts. This is always just a short link to one of my blog posts along with a blurb, and is something that you can set up to happen automatically. As this blog is backed by WordPress, from this point forward I\u2019ll be using the excellent \u2018[Add Link to Facebook](http:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/add-link-to-facebook\/)\u2018 plugin which auto-posts my blog posts to my Facebook wall. Really, you don\u2019t even have to get rid of Facebook to be rid of Facebook. Much like a search engine, Facebook becomes just another channel via which your data travels without your intervention.\n\n> \u2026 you don\u2019t even have to get rid of Facebook to be rid of Facebook. \u2026Facebook becomes just another channel via which your data travels without your intervention.\n\n**Sharing with \u201cThose Who Only Use Facebook\u201d**\n\n> \u2026 there are those who only use the internet a single purpose: to Facebook. How do you cut Facebook out of your own life without cutting yourself out of theirs?\n\nStrange as it may sound, there are those who only use the internet a single purpose: to Facebook. How do you cut Facebook out of your own life without cutting yourself out of theirs? For me, the answer came in two forms. Direct email, and a WordPress plugin. Any personal communication that needs to happen can happen via email, even if it\u2019s directly into the Facebook email system via that users @facebook.com email account. Certainly encourage them to move to a dedicated email client, but don\u2019t be too surprised if that doesn\u2019t occur. Any public communication (i.e. blog posts, public photos, work announcements) will be automatically posted to my Facebook through \u2018[Add Link to Facebook](http:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/add-link-to-facebook\/)\u2018 as described above. These contacts likely won\u2019t even notice a change, other than an increase in actual personal communication between you.\n\n> These contacts likely won\u2019t even notice a change, other than an increase in actual personal communication between you.\n\n**Keeping in Touch**\n\nHere\u2019s something that Facebook has been less and less successful at: allowing you to truly communicate with people past the surface level. A week ago I declared on my Facebook wall that I would be answering any posts and comments via direct email. In the immediate days following this announcement I had a number of in-depth, often emotional email conversations with friends that I hadn\u2019t really talked to in years. We had certainly posted little blurbs on each others wall, but it held no emotional weight. By encouraging everyone to engage in everyone else\u2019s conversations, Facebook has removed the collective emotional weight of our discourse. How then, to regain our intimacy? Email. As strange as it may sound, Email is both ubiquitous and capable of carrying as much emotional depth as you can muster. While video calls give an immediate connection, how do you keep in touch with 200+ friends and relatives via video chat? There just aren\u2019t enough hours in the day.\n\nSo export your Facebook contacts right away. If you have a Gmail account, I recommend using [Google Contacts Sync](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/googlecontactsync) to bring in all your Facebook friends into your Google contacts list. From there, you can export them as a CSV to your email client of choice. Now that you\u2019ve got all your Facebook contacts in Gmail the truly hard part begins: Admitting to yourself that most of these people would not naturally be in your worldview, and do not in any meaningful way affect your existence.\n\n> Now that you\u2019ve got all your Facebook contacts in Gmail the truly hard part begins: Admitting to yourself that most of these people would not naturally be in your worldview, and do not in any meaningful way affect your existence.\n\nThat\u2019s a hard pill to swallow, to be sure. It may feel like you\u2019re going from having \u201chundreds\u201d of friends to having \u201ca few\u201d friends. Are you? In this day and age, it\u2019s incredibly easy to look someone up. If you dropped Facebook today, how many of your connections would ever type your name into their email client? Are these people contributing to your life?\n\nAfter a great deal of time wrestling with this issue, I believe the answer is no. I\u2019ve easily spent over an hour a day for the past ten years checking Facebook (and Myspace before it). Many days two or three. Is that healthy? What did I gain? In ten years I made one actual new friend because of social media, and it was back on Myspace when you could meet strangers geographically. Social media is a false affirmation that I gave myself daily for ten years. I should have been playing the guitar instead.\n\nSeriously, think about every \u2018deep\u2019 conversation you ever had on Facebook. It shouldn\u2019t take you long. Add in every photo that changed your life, every news item that you would have never seen on any other media outlet, and every social outing you went on solely because you found out through Facebook. It likely still won\u2019t take more than a few minutes\u2026, and I almost guarantee you that you can count those times on your hands and toes. Consider then how many posts you made in total, how many posts your friends and coworkers have made in total. Millions of hours, millions of posts, an avalanche of trivialities. What have we been doing all this time? I say now, for me, that every single one of those important photos, conversations, and events could have and in the future will have been made over email and real interpersonal exchange.\n\n> Social media is a false affirmation that I gave myself daily for ten years. I should have been playing the guitar instead.\n\n**Bottom line:**\n\n- If you want to make new friends: find a local Reddit or meetup group. Facebook has little return on investment.\n- If you want to strengthen the friendships you have: email your friends.\n- If you need to make immediate plans: txt your friends directly. If you don\u2019t have their phone numbers you should think to yourself \u201cWhy am I trying to make immediate plans with someone who has never shared their phone number with me?\u201d\n- If you need a place to back-up your photos then use a dedicated back-up service. Many give you tens of gigabytes of storage for free.\n- If you want to share photos with a group of people, email them directly. Facebook provides no guarantee the viewer won\u2019t download the images (and is in that respect no better than email), and the Facebook corporation uses your image data for their own nefarious purposes. Honestly, you should first ask yourself if these people really need to see some photos of something that you did, and if you\u2019re fine with all of their friends\/coworkers\/relatives seeing those photos too?\n- If you want to share photos publicly, consider getting a blog where you host your images (perhaps in galleries). Only then can you control the data.\n- If you have contacts who solely communicate through Facebook, email them directly at their @facebook.com email addresses, encourage them to move to a dedicated email provider, and link your personal blog to your Facebook account.\n\nI know it sounds tough, but with a little perseverance you too can remove Facebook from your life, increase your free time, and improve your interpersonal relationships through real communication.

I put social in quotes because Facebook has ceased to be a means to socialize.  The signal to noise ratio is too high.  People use their cell phones to txt or email any immediate information, and the sharing of photos has started to migrate to other sites (sites with less draconian business practices).  &#8220;Moving Away From Facebook&#8221; has become a popular topic, and this trend will only continue.  After 8 years of daily usage there&#8217;s no easy way to do this, so I figure it&#8217;s better to rip it off like a bandage and remove it completely.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how I&#8217;m moving away from Facebook: replace each of the above items.  I believe that it can be done, without much difficulty.  The first step is getting your data out of Facebook.  Luckily, nowadays they make this rather easy for you.  You can move away from Facebook, and your life will be better for it.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>You <em>can<\/em> move away from Facebook, and your life will be better for it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Birthdays<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For birthdays, Facebook allows you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/206619532710687\/\">export all of your birthday data<\/a> as a calendar you can import on your iCal or Google Calendar (or <a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/?fromgroups#!forum\/jquery-week-calendar\">open source calendar<\/a>).  So now you won&#8217;t need to log into Facebook to check whose birthday is coming up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Photos<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Photos are a difficult problem.  On the one hand, it&#8217;s very easy to post your photo up to Facebook from your phone.  On the other hand, who knows how that photo will be used, and who will eventually end up looking at it.  Yeah, maybe a second cousin once removed is considered a family member, but do you really want anyone who uses their computer to be able to browse photos of your 8 year old&#8217;s recital?  Where does it end?  We are just now realizing as a society that the ubiquitous surveillance that comes from social media may be depriving our youth of their ability to be young and reckless.  It&#8217;s certainly depriving us of a shared sense of privacy, and often dignity.  Remember when the pain of looking at boring vacation photos was a trope brought up in movies and television?  When did that change?  When our cell phones became our cameras, did our vacations become inherently more interesting?  Maybe we&#8217;re all just paying less attention, with our second and third screens ever vying for our wandering eyes?  <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When our cell phones became our cameras, did our vacations become inherently more interesting?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>At any rate, there are many competing services for photo hosting.  I personally recommend allowing multiple competing services (Box, DropBox, Google) to back up all your photos for you.  They all have facilities for sharing or emailing photos, and you&#8217;ll sleep better at night knowing the creepy big data teams at Facebook aren&#8217;t using your photos to learn something about your purchasing behavior.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the quick-start guide to getting photo data out of Facebook, <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Back up all your Facebook photos that you&#8217;ve previously updated.  You can do this in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/131112897028467\/\">one fell swoop<\/a> directly from Facebook.<\/li>\n<li>Download all the photos that you&#8217;ve been tagged in.  <a href=\"https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/photograbber\/downloads\/list\">PhotoGrabber <\/a>is a great piece of software to accomplish this.<\/li>\n<li>Set up a replacement photo backup service on your phone.  DropBox and Box both have fine products to accomplish this, both of which have apps that set up the process for you and don&#8217;t mine your data for facial heuristics. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Personal Advertising<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the main reasons I keep my Facebook account is as an avenue to promote my apps\/games\/products\/blog posts.  This is always just a short link to one of my blog posts along with a blurb, and is something that you can set up to happen automatically.  As this blog is backed by WordPress, from this point forward I&#8217;ll be using the excellent &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/add-link-to-facebook\/\">Add Link to Facebook<\/a>&#8216; plugin which auto-posts my blog posts to my Facebook wall.  Really, you don&#8217;t even have to get rid of Facebook to be rid of Facebook.  Much like a search engine, Facebook becomes just another channel via which your data travels without your intervention.  <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; you don&#8217;t even have to get rid of Facebook to be rid of Facebook.  &#8230;Facebook becomes just another channel via which your data travels without your intervention.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sharing with &#8220;Those Who Only Use Facebook&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; there are those who only use the internet a single purpose: to Facebook.

How do you cut Facebook out of your own life without cutting yourself out of theirs?  For me, the answer came in two forms.  Direct email, and a WordPress plugin.  Any personal communication that needs to happen can happen via email, even if it&#8217;s directly into the Facebook email system via that users @facebook.com email account.  Certainly encourage them to move to a dedicated email client, but don&#8217;t be too surprised if that doesn&#8217;t occur.  Any public communication (i.e. blog posts, public photos, work announcements) will be automatically posted to my Facebook through &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/add-link-to-facebook\/\">Add Link to Facebook<\/a>&#8216; as described above.  These contacts likely won&#8217;t even notice a change, other than an increase in actual personal communication between you. <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>These contacts likely won&#8217;t even notice a change, other than an increase in actual personal communication between you. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Keeping in Touch<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s something that Facebook has been less and less successful at: allowing you to truly communicate with people past the surface level.  A week ago I declared on my Facebook wall that I would be answering any posts and comments via direct email.  In the immediate days following this announcement I had a number of in-depth, often emotional email conversations with friends that I hadn&#8217;t really talked to in years.  We had certainly posted little blurbs on each others wall, but it held no emotional weight.  By encouraging everyone to engage in everyone else&#8217;s conversations, Facebook has removed the collective emotional weight of our discourse.  How then, to regain our intimacy?  Email.  As strange as it may sound, Email is both ubiquitous and capable of carrying as much emotional depth as you can muster.  While video calls give an immediate connection, how do you keep in touch with 200+ friends and relatives via video chat?  There just aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day.  <\/p>\n<p>So export your Facebook contacts right away.  If you have a Gmail account, I recommend using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/googlecontactsync\">Google Contacts Sync<\/a> to bring in all your Facebook friends into your Google contacts list.  From there, you can export them as a CSV to your email client of choice.  Now that you&#8217;ve got all your Facebook contacts in Gmail the truly hard part begins: Admitting to yourself that most of these people would not naturally be in your worldview, and do not in any meaningful way affect your existence. <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Now that you&#8217;ve got all your Facebook contacts in Gmail the truly hard part begins: Admitting to yourself that most of these people would not naturally be in your worldview, and do not in any meaningful way affect your existence. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s a hard pill to swallow, to be sure.  It may feel like you&#8217;re going from having &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of friends to having &#8220;a few&#8221; friends.  Are you?  In this day and age, it&#8217;s incredibly easy to look someone up.  If you dropped Facebook today, how many of your connections would ever type your name into their email client?  Are these people contributing to your life?<\/p>\n<p>After a great deal of time wrestling with this issue, I believe the answer is no.  I&#8217;ve easily spent over an hour a day for the past ten years checking Facebook (and Myspace before it).  Many days two or three.  Is that healthy?  What did I gain?  In ten years I made one actual new friend because of social media, and it was back on Myspace when you could meet strangers geographically.  Social media is a false affirmation that I gave myself daily for ten years.  I should have been playing the guitar instead.  <\/p>\n<p>Seriously, think about every &#8216;deep&#8217; conversation you ever had on Facebook.  It shouldn&#8217;t take you long.  Add in every photo that changed your life, every news item that you would have never seen on any other media outlet, and every social outing you went on solely because you found out through Facebook.  It likely still won&#8217;t take more than a few minutes&#8230;, and I almost guarantee you that you can count those times on your hands and toes.  Consider then how many posts you made in total, how many posts your friends and coworkers have made in total.  Millions of hours, millions of posts, an avalanche of trivialities.  What have we been doing all this time?  I say now, for me, that every single one of those important photos, conversations, and events could have and in the future will have been made over email and real interpersonal exchange.  <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Social media is a false affirmation that I gave myself daily for ten years.  I should have been playing the guitar instead.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to make new friends: find a local Reddit or meetup group.  Facebook has little return on investment.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to strengthen the friendships you have: email your friends.<\/li>\n<li>If you need to make immediate plans: txt your friends directly.  If you don&#8217;t have their phone numbers you should think to yourself &#8220;Why am I trying to make immediate plans with someone who has never shared their phone number with me?&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>If you need a place to back-up your photos then use a dedicated back-up service.  Many give you tens of gigabytes of storage for free.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to share photos with a group of people, email them directly.  Facebook provides no guarantee the viewer won&#8217;t download the images (and is in that respect no better than email), and the Facebook corporation uses your image data for their own nefarious purposes.

Retrode + Ouya + N64 Controller and Cartridge = Right Out of The Box Fun","slug":"video-retrode-ouya-n64-controller-and-cartridge-right-out-of-the-box-fun","markdown":"\nIt\u2019s official. The [Ouya](http:\/\/www.ouya.tv\/) supports the [Retrode](http:\/\/www.retrode.org\/) (and the [N64 plug-in adapter](https:\/\/www.retrode.com\/plug-in-adapters\/)) out of the box, with no special settings required. Honestly, this is huge. If you wanted a reason to love the [Ouya](http:\/\/www.ouya.tv\/) but were just waiting for a killer app, you just got one.\n\n> Honestly, this is huge.\n\nHere you have a game console which supports retro gaming adapters out of the box. You can take this thing into a place of business and retro game without breaking any laws. Play some MarioKart 64 with your coworkers without having to dig around thrift stores for a N64 system, then switch it up and play SNES\/Genesis\/GB\/GBC\/GBA\/SMS cartridges too, all without downloading any ROMS! Review old games with the full TV experience without having to install a modchip, root anything, boot up a PC, or even purchase the original consoles. Perhaps best of all you can dust off your old cartridges and share your favorite classic gaming experiences with your kids, confident in the knowledge that you\u2019re not teaching them to pirate games. You might even help to instill a love of old games in a whole new generation of gamers.\n\nHere\u2019s how I set the whole thing up in just a couple minutes:\n\n1.

The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ouya.tv\/\">Ouya<\/a> supports the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.retrode.org\/\">Retrode<\/a> (and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.retrode.com\/plug-in-adapters\/\">N64 plug-in adapter<\/a>) out of the box, with no special settings required.

You can take this thing into a place of business and retro game without breaking any laws.  Play some MarioKart 64 with your coworkers without having to dig around thrift stores for a N64 system, then switch it up and play SNES\/Genesis\/GB\/GBC\/GBA\/SMS cartridges too, all without downloading any ROMS!  Review old games with the full TV experience without having to install a modchip, root anything, boot up a PC, or even purchase the original consoles.  Perhaps best of all you can dust off your old cartridges and share your favorite classic gaming experiences with your kids, confident in the knowledge that you&#8217;re not teaching them to pirate games.  You might even help to instill a love of old games in a whole new generation of gamers.  <\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how I set the whole thing up in just a couple minutes:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Went to the &#8216;retro&#8217; section on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ouya.tv\/\">Ouya<\/a> store<\/li>\n<li>Downloaded the Mupen64 app<\/li>\n<li>Mapped the buttons (using the controller settings menu in Mupen64) to the real N64 controller buttons<\/li>\n<li>Told Mupen64 to load the cartridge from \/mnt\/usbdrive\/ (the Retrode shows up as a USB drive on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ouya.tv\/\">Ouya<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>That&#8217;s that!

A \u201cpractically new\u201d AlphaSmart digital typewriter for 3$, untested. It was in great condition, so I had to take a chance. I got more, way more, than I bargained for.\n\n[![Alpha](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/2013-07-15-17.56.57-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/2013-07-15-17.56.57.jpg)\n\nFor those not in the know, the AlphaSmart was a portable typewriter\/keyboard which you could use either as a keyboard for your mac, or as a portable word processor. Each of the F1-F8 keys opened a simple character buffer for text entry. When you were done, you plugged it back into your mac and dumped each file out over the serial port. I always make it a point to buy one if I see one, but it\u2019s been 10 years now since I have. Why do I always buy these antiquated devices? Because many a writer used them out in the field. They ran for 100+ hours on 2 AA batteries. That\u2019s 4 straight days. They were, once upon a time, popular. They were used by receptionists and university students to take notes. You never know what you\u2019ll find on the buffers contained on a device like that. The lost Douglas Adams novel? It\u2019s out there people! You never know.\n\n> I had to take a chance. I got more, way more, than I bargained for.\n\nSo I threw a couple of AA batteries in there, and what did greet my eyes but text. Provocative and inviting prose. Two sentences in I knew. I knew this one was a winner. I knew I wanted to know what had become of this author. I knew I had to dump the entire thing out to file, somehow.\n\nThe device uses an old style apple ADB bus keyboard port. These are not pin compatible with the old PS\/2 ports, but it\u2019s easy enough to wire up a teensy to do the conversion. Griffin also made a USB adapter that you can sometimes manage to pick up on eBay for about 30$. Though I didn\u2019t find one locally (always check your local second-hand computer stores!), I did manage to find an eBay seller who took a 20$ buy-it-now offer. Apparently people are not using ADB keyboards as much as they did in \u2026 oh\u2026 the 1980s. True story.\n\n[![Rarer than gold](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/2013-07-19-16.47.09-225x300.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/2013-07-19-16.47.09.jpg)\n\nSo I waited a few days, got the adapter, and plugged it into the keyboard via a M-M cable they DID have at my local second-hand shop. I fired up OpenOffice, clicked into the input area, and hit \u2018send\u2019 on the keyboard.\n\nI sat there, in front of my computer, in equal measures intrigued and aghast at what came across my screen. Slowly, almost in real-time, a chapter began. It is as if the ghost of this young writer is sitting at my keyboard. Words begin to fill up the screen and the soundless void through which they appear, FULLY CAPITALIZED and at a human pace, is more terrifying than any horror movie soundtrack. A story begins. I am fixated. It is a coming of age story in a fantasy setting. The main character is discovering she is a lesbian, which is doubly difficult for her because she is in love with a centaur. A centaur who is \u2018too old\u2019 for her, and the other stags.. wait is she a deer? A freaking doe? Anyway, this centaur has been called a child molester by some. This book is getting \u2026 kind of unsettling.\n\n(Made a bit more unsettling due to low quality of the animated gif)\n\n[![textfilling](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/textfilling.gif)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/textfilling.gif)\n\n> Does it count as furry if they are cross-species and one is half-human?\n\nBut still I sit. I sit and I read and I experience a \u201cfurry\u201d (does it count as furry if they are cross-species and one is half-human?) coming of age story, about centaurs and phoenixes, some kind of song magic, and \u2026 rumors of child molestation? From the word choices I am guessing this author is fresh, still feeling out his or her voice. A voice that\u2019s talented enough to write a fantasy novel, but not yet talented enough to keep the thread of story alive. Still, these pages are just the beginnings of a novel, and incomplete. Something is bothering me.\n\nThe first character buffer nags at me.. mocking me. What was it that I read in the ancient instruction manual I managed to find in the cracks of archive.org? Ahh yes. These little wonders included the ability to \u2018undelete\u2019 a file!\n\n[![DataRecovery](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/DataRecovery-300x126.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/DataRecovery.png)\n\n> Would this empty file contain a hidden treasure? The author\u2019s name? The \u201clost\u201d first chapter of the book?\n\nWould this empty file contain a hidden treasure? The author\u2019s name? The \u201clost\u201d first chapter of the book? It could have been any of those things, but no, it was none of those things. It was high school homework, followed by a verbatim conversation between \u2018you\u2019 and \u2018me\u2019. The conversation was simply the instructions given to the student by their instructor for completion of the assignment. This was followed by political back story to the above novel that eerily matched up with the topic of the homework assignment. This author, like many, was pulling from their own experiences to craft a story. This, unfortunately, has some pretty serious possible implications considering the subject material. This novel could be this author\u2019s therapy, their way of coping or dealing with a difficult situation. A situation that happened 20 years ago. This archaeological dig had taken an unexpected turn straight into an ethical wall.\n\nI had planned to post of the text of this novel once dumped, and to try and track down the author, and see if the material ever made it into a published work. What a fascinating story that would be! A writer finding a lost journal, a blogger experiencing the growth of an author first hand. Readers\u2026 reading. Something everyone could share. As it stands, I think the right thing to do is let the story stay private, this young author\u2019s dreams and hopes locked away in a digital journal. It\u2019s a very personal work, and if it was part of their therapy that\u2019s all the more reason not to share it. But I did read it. It was there, and knowing what I knew I read it. If I had recovered buffer #1 first I may not have read the other chapters. But I did. So I\u2019m going to be doing a bit more research on this and see where it leads. If I can find the author, I\u2019m going to tell them this story, show them this blog post, and give them a thumbdrive with a story on it. One hell of a story.\n\n> If I had recovered buffer #1 first I may not have read the other chapters. But I did.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019ve got the best (and sadly, perhaps the most hipster) setup for blogging at the coffee shop.\n\n<table><tr><td>[![keepin it meta](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/20130719_181311-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/20130719_181311.jpg)<\/td><td>[![keepin it hipster](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/20130719_181437-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/20130719_181437.jpg)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\n","html":"<p>Last week at the thrift shop I had an amazing find.

There\u2019s no way I can avoid reviewing it first, as it\u2019s the reason I got on Steam in the first place. Like most everyone else, the first time I decided I absolutely *had* to get on steam was when I read you could install Half-Life 2 directly from it. I had built a very powerful (perhaps a Geforce 3?) gaming pc to play Half-Life 2. I was ready from the moment I had finished Half-Life 2 (3am Jan 2nd 1999, and a story unto itself). While my gaming dollar (and the prerequisite graphical upgrade) could not be swayed by Doom 3, Half-Life 2 made a demand of my wallet which I just couldn\u2019t resist.\n\n[![2013-08-06_00007](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00007-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00007.jpg)\n\n> The real story I\u2019m beginning to see? It\u2019s that a trip through my Steam games list is a trip through my 20s.\n\nI fire up Steam and I install Half-Life 2 in about an hour. (I remember it took at least 3 hours back on 04, so at least my download speed has improved marginally) So vividly did I remember the that came along with this screen that I didn\u2019t realize my speakers were turned off. How many times had I seen this screen in the past ten years? Hundreds, if not thousands of times. It takes me back. Back when my gaming rig was the center of my universe. I had a huge tri-corner desk set up which took up the better part of our spare bedroom. In the center was a (must have been 50lbs) 19\u2033 CRT. The lights were dimmed and smoke was gently flowing in the air (some things never change.) I was ready for an adventure, ready to experience a story, as I am now. The real story I\u2019m beginning to see? It\u2019s that a trip through my Steam games list is a trip through my 20s.\n\nYou see, In 2004 I was 23, and as such I had just started working at my first post-collegiate job. I finally had enough money scraped together to spend on a decent gaming rig and I was going to be sure to flex that money wisely. I made a full 1\/3 of my current salary. That was just shy of 10 years ago. Gaming provided a much needed avenue of escape to one poor gamer in the middle of nowhere. Half-Life 2 was, at the time, the pinnacle of that escapism. Beautiful, exciting, fully absorbing. How would I find it now, a family man in my 30s?\n\n[![Headcrabs!](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00015-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00015.jpg)\n\nThough they have aged, the graphics in HL2 have aged well. The textures, even when pushed up to maximum, don\u2019t exactly hold up to current generation showstoppers like \u2018The Last of Us\u2019. They hold up, but not brilliantly. The game-play however, is brilliant. Every scene is deliberately paced. The game doesn\u2019t force you down a path as much as it hides the fact that the path you chose was the only way to go. Right from the ge-go every scene paints a picture of the world you\u2019ve woken up into. The only breaks in the narrative are those brought by loading screens. Even the pause\/menu screen has characters and dialog. I should mention that though they are short lived, loading screens do pop up somewhat frequently, and they do distract from the narrative.\n\n[![2013-08-05_00005](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-05_00005-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-05_00005.jpg)\n\nWhat a narrative it is though! Secrets, world domination, hidden dimensional spies. It\u2019s everything from HL1 and an extra dose of post apocalyptic fun. You awake into a brutal world and must immediately play along, hide, immerse yourself into an unfamiliar world full of aliens. From a game-play perspective things start out slow. Use some boxes to build a ladder to that window (and show off the new physics engine). Run quick before they catch you! Catch your breath, and sneak. The pacing is deliberate, and masterful.\n\n[![2013-08-06_00014](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00014-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00014.jpg)\n\nThe game introduces you to Alex pretty quickly, which is great because she\u2019s the prototype \u201cKick-Ass but Emotionally Relatable NPC\u201d. From an AI perspective she doesn\u2019t get in your way and doesn\u2019t bog down the story or gun-play. She\u2019s also a very likable character, her changing emotional state providing an additional layer of immersion into the story. The player character (Gordon Freeman, you) never speaks, and is never heard on camera. I highly recommend playing through with developer\u2019s commentary turned on, as the rational behind the ever-silent protagonist (player immersion) has been both lauded and hotly debated in the decade since HL2 released.\n\n[![2013-08-06_00003](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00003-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00003.jpg)\n\nIt\u2019s not enough though, to have an interesting story and likable characters. A blockbuster AAA title needs to feature a hero\u2019s journey, and an epic struggle. HL2 delivers in scores. One of the most memorable scenes occurs maybe 1\/3 of the way into the game. You\u2019ve done some light shooting, and you\u2019ve slowly been building up your arsenal and hiding\/killing your way though some alien soldiers. Lots of story, everything slowly building up to\u2026 something. As a gamer you can feel it.\n\n> Valve set the bar for what makes a \u201cmodern\u201d shooter, and it hasn\u2019t been raised much higher in the decade since.\n\n[![2013-08-06_00008](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00008-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00008.jpg)\n\nAfter all that deliberate pacing, all those minor soldiers you had to flank and run around, you\u2019re ready for something. So what does Valve do? They throw you into a boat level and let you run from, then destroy some helicopters. This blew me away when it was released. I clearly wasn\u2019t the only one as it feels like it could have been plucked from any modern shooter. The \u201cswitch up the game-play completely for one minor boss level\u201d tactic isn\u2019t new to the fps genre, but Half Life 2 was the first game in my memory where it really worked. It felt like a brief jaunt into a more modern Metal Slug game.  \n[![2013-08-06_00016](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00016-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00016.jpg)\n\nThe longer I play HL2, the more I feel that I should stop using the term \u201cmodern\u201d to describes games which came after it.

I had only originally intended to play for an hour or two (having beat the game many, many times).

There&#8217;s no way I can avoid reviewing it first, as it&#8217;s the reason I got on Steam in the first place.  Like most everyone else, the first time I decided I absolutely <em>had<\/em> to get on steam was when I read you could install Half-Life 2 directly from it.  I had built a very powerful (perhaps a Geforce 3?) gaming pc to play Half-Life 2.  I was ready from the moment I had finished Half-Life 2 (3am Jan 2nd 1999, and a story unto itself).  While my gaming dollar (and the prerequisite graphical upgrade) could not be swayed by Doom 3, Half-Life 2 made a demand of my wallet which I just couldn&#8217;t resist.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00007.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00007-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-06_00007\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4275\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00007-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00007-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00007.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The real story I&#8217;m beginning to see?  It&#8217;s that a trip through my Steam games list is a trip through my 20s. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I fire up Steam and I install Half-Life 2 in about an hour. (I remember it took at least 3 hours back on 04, so at least my download speed has improved marginally) So vividly did I remember the that came along with this screen that I didn&#8217;t realize my speakers were turned off.  How many times had I seen this screen in the past ten years?  Hundreds, if not thousands of times.  It takes me back.  Back when my gaming rig was the center of my universe.  I had a huge tri-corner desk set up which took up the better part of our spare bedroom.  In the center was a (must have been 50lbs) 19&#8243; CRT.  The lights were dimmed and smoke was gently flowing in the air (some things never change.) I was ready for an adventure, ready to experience a story, as I am now.  The real story I&#8217;m beginning to see?  It&#8217;s that a trip through my Steam games list is a trip through my 20s.<\/p>\n<p>You see, In 2004 I was 23, and as such I had just started working at my first post-collegiate job.  I finally had enough money scraped together to spend on a decent gaming rig and I was going to be sure to flex that money wisely.  I made a full 1\/3 of my current salary.  That was just shy of 10 years ago.  Gaming provided a much needed avenue of escape to one poor gamer in the middle of nowhere.  Half-Life 2 was, at the time, the pinnacle of that escapism.  Beautiful, exciting, fully absorbing.  How would I find it now, a family man in my 30s?  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00015.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00015-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"Headcrabs!\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4269\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00015-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00015-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00015.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Though they have aged, the graphics in HL2 have aged well.  The textures, even when pushed up to maximum, don&#8217;t exactly hold up to current generation showstoppers like &#8216;The Last of Us&#8217;.  They hold up, but not brilliantly.  The game-play however, is brilliant.  Every scene is deliberately paced.  The game doesn&#8217;t force you down a path as much as it hides the fact that the path you chose was the only way to go.  Right from the ge-go every scene paints a picture of the world you&#8217;ve woken up into.  The only breaks in the narrative are those brought by loading screens.  Even the pause\/menu screen has characters and dialog.  I should mention that though they are short lived, loading screens do pop up somewhat frequently, and they do distract from the narrative.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-05_00005.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-05_00005-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-05_00005\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4264\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-05_00005-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-05_00005-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-05_00005.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>What a narrative it is though!  Secrets, world domination, hidden dimensional spies.  It&#8217;s everything from HL1 and an extra dose of post apocalyptic fun.  You awake into a brutal world and must immediately play along, hide, immerse yourself into an unfamiliar world full of aliens.  From a game-play perspective things start out slow.  Use some boxes to build a ladder to that window (and show off the new physics engine). Run quick before they catch you!  Catch your breath, and sneak. The pacing is deliberate, and masterful.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00014.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00014-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-06_00014\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4268\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00014-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00014-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00014.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The game introduces you to Alex pretty quickly, which is great because she&#8217;s the prototype &#8220;Kick-Ass but Emotionally Relatable NPC&#8221;.  From an AI perspective she doesn&#8217;t get in your way and doesn&#8217;t bog down the story or gun-play. She&#8217;s also a very likable character, her changing emotional state providing an additional layer of immersion into the story.  The player character (Gordon Freeman, you) never speaks, and is never heard on camera.  I highly recommend playing through with developer&#8217;s commentary turned on, as the rational behind the ever-silent protagonist (player immersion) has been both lauded and hotly debated in the decade since HL2 released. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00003.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00003-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-06_00003\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4263\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00003-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00003-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-06_00003.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not enough though, to have an interesting story and likable characters.  A blockbuster AAA title needs to feature a hero&#8217;s journey, and an epic struggle.  HL2 delivers in scores.  One of the most memorable scenes occurs maybe 1\/3 of the way into the game.  You&#8217;ve done some light shooting, and you&#8217;ve slowly been building up your arsenal and hiding\/killing your way though some alien soldiers.  Lots of story, everything slowly building up to&#8230; something.

It\u2019s crazy appealing to Contra fans but won\u2019t jump out at the casual gamer, plus the jumping portions may put off a great many modern gamer as well. I had forgotten exactly how frustrating wide-gap jumps can be. I can take crazy bullet hell. I can take acceleration-based jump puzzles (Mario, Portal, Sonic). A wide-gap jump with no acceleration is simply a test of your ability to jump at the last possible moment.

This adds a level of competition to your game-play, and helps to spice up the run of the mill Contra-clone experience. The 8-bit visuals come off as somewhat drab. I wish this was a 16-Bit Commando review.

You&#8217;re not in for any surprises here, it&#8217;s standard Contra fare.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/falme.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/falme-300x232.png\" alt=\"falme\" width=\"300\" height=\"232\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4287\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/falme-300x232.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/falme-1024x793.png 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/falme.png 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re looking to pick up 8-Bit Commando, I&#8217;d ask yourself one question.  Do you like Contra?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The levels feel like the 2d portions from the NES, SNES, and GB versions of Contra, all done in the original NES style.  If you&#8217;ve noticed that every sentence of this review seems to contain Contra, it&#8217;s because I cannot stress enough that this game is simply an online-ranked Contra with more respawn points and infinite continues.  It&#8217;s crazy appealing to Contra fans but won&#8217;t jump out at the casual gamer, plus the jumping portions may put off a great many modern gamer as well.  I had forgotten exactly how frustrating wide-gap jumps can be.  I can take crazy bullet hell.  I can take acceleration-based jump puzzles (Mario, Portal, Sonic).  A wide-gap jump with no acceleration is simply a test of your ability to jump at the last possible moment.  That&#8217;s not a particularly fun core game mechanic.  <\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4288\" style=\"width: 306px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/gameover.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/gameover-300x232.png\" alt=\"Prepare to see this screen, a lot\" width=\"300\" height=\"232\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4288\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/gameover-300x232.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/gameover-1024x793.png 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/gameover.png 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Prepare to see this screen, a lot<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Regardless, there&#8217;s some fun to be had with 8-Bit Commando for those of us who don&#8217;t live and breath Contra.  While I was never ranked above #3000 online, I definitely saw my rank slowly starting to rise as I played.  This adds a level of competition to your game-play, and helps to spice up the run of the mill Contra-clone experience.   The 8-bit visuals come off as somewhat drab.  I wish this was a 16-Bit Commando review.  If you&#8217;re looking to pick up 8-Bit Commando, I&#8217;d ask yourself one question:  Do you like the NES of Contra enough to play it again, even after having played Contra 3 on the SNES?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d rate it 68%, a decent showing for fans of the Contra.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/ummmcontra.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/ummmcontra-300x232.png\" alt=\"ummmcontra\" width=\"300\" height=\"232\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4289\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/ummmcontra-300x232.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/ummmcontra-1024x793.png 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/ummmcontra.png 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/title.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sat, 10 Aug 2013 01:39:06 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 22 Sep 2013 17:12:48 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 10 Aug 2013 01:39:06 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4294,"title":"NDS Emulator DraStic Raises the Emulation Bar Very, Very High","slug":"nds-emulator-drastic-raises-the-emulation-bar-very-very-high","markdown":"\nThis isn\u2019t a game review as much as a software review.

From the title I assume it\u2019s a graphic novel, perhaps a parody. I also assume it came from a humble bundle.\n\nOne nice thing about indie games is that they tend to err on the side of \u2018lower end pcs\u2019 when it comes to minimum specs. That means for the forseeable future I\u2019ll be reviewing games from my Athlon 64 X2 3800+ pc with an aging Gefore 8200gs at the graphical helm. This isn\u2019t so much more powerful than some of the new tablets coming out nowadays, and certainly no faster than the Haswell generation of integration graphics.\n\nAnalogue: A Hate Story (referred to as A:AHS) is apparently a text adventure game, at least from the outset. I was honestly pretty surprised when I saw the initial logon screen. Unphased (I DID used to espout the virtues of DOS to anyone who would listen), I start \u201chacking\u201d away at the console. How would I define \u201chacking\u201d in this sense? Blindly typing commands into a terminal, hoping to glean some information.\n\nAfter typing a few unix-y commands into the console I manage to enable the \u2018virtual AI\u2019. This is your typical anime protagonist of the female variety: No-nonsense and quite young looking.\n\n[![interaction](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/interaction-300x195.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/interaction.png)\n\nIt feels like the game is trying to teach me rudimentalry unix commands. There\u2019s a filesystem with a block format layout which contain logs. At the heart of it these are just plot items. The terminal itself has a superuser concept, and accepts the typical unix \u2018su\u2019 superuser command. Unfortunately figuring out the password to use said command is an exercise in tedium. Read through logs and old emails and \u201cinteract\u201d with the AI. Maybe I just don\u2019t get visual novel games? Is this the heart of the gameplay? Where is the gripping story? What is the message? That polygamy leads to hurt feelings? It doesn\u2019t exactly make for a compelling experience.\n\n[![sexism](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/sexism-300x187.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/sexism.png)\n\nThe game is a bit of a mix between visual novel and unix tutorial. The backstory documents feature a detailed family tree and an ancestral Korean polygymist backstory. I could not be less engaged with the story.\n\nOn some level, this game may be exploring sexism in Korean society. I can\u2019t tell. They say that it is the youth who have no patience but I think that is only part of the story.

From the title I assume it&#8217;s a graphic novel, perhaps a parody.  I also assume it came from a humble bundle.<\/p>\n<p>One nice thing about indie games is that they tend to err on the side of &#8216;lower end pcs&#8217; when it comes to minimum specs.  That means for the forseeable future I&#8217;ll be reviewing games from my Athlon 64 X2 3800+ pc with an aging Gefore 8200gs at the graphical helm.  This isn&#8217;t so much more powerful than some of the new tablets coming out nowadays, and certainly no faster than the Haswell generation of integration graphics.<\/p>\n<p>Analogue: A Hate Story (referred to as A:AHS) is apparently a text adventure game, at least from the outset.  I was honestly pretty surprised when I saw the initial logon screen.  Unphased (I DID used to espout the virtues of DOS to anyone who would listen), I start &#8220;hacking&#8221; away at the console.  How would I define &#8220;hacking&#8221; in this sense?  Blindly typing commands into a terminal, hoping to glean some information.<\/p>\n<p>After typing a few unix-y commands into the console I manage to enable the &#8216;virtual AI&#8217;.  This is your typical anime protagonist of the female variety:  No-nonsense and quite young looking.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/interaction.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/interaction-300x195.png\" alt=\"interaction\" width=\"300\" height=\"195\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4310\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/interaction-300x195.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/interaction-1024x667.png 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/interaction.png 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It feels like the game is trying to teach me rudimentalry unix commands.  There&#8217;s a filesystem with a block format layout which contain logs.  At the heart of it these are just plot items.  The terminal itself has a superuser concept, and accepts the typical unix &#8216;su&#8217; superuser command.  Unfortunately figuring out the password to use said command is an exercise in tedium.  Read through logs and old emails and &#8220;interact&#8221; with the AI.  Maybe I just don&#8217;t get visual novel games?  Is this the heart of the gameplay?  Where is the gripping story?  What is the message?  That polygamy leads to hurt feelings?

Characters still share emotions clearly, and there\u2019s no subtlety lost due to texture issues.\n\nAs with all previous Half Life titles, the health and armor game mechanics are of the classic \u2018regularly scattered power ups\u2019 type.\n\nThe voice acting is still excellent, and the emotional connections you made with the characters in the previous game shine through brightly. This is high drama, with well paced tension and regular action segments interspersed throughout.\n\n[![2013-08-11_00019](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00019-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00019.jpg)\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s more than a few minutes before you get to any action. The first 10-15 minutes is pure story-line, and excellently serves to draw you back into the dystopian world of Gordon Freeman.\n\nThe familiar characters, engrossing world, and action game fun all blend masterfully into a brilliant, of short gaming experience.\n\nIn a way, Half Life 2: Episode 1 is my favorite of the Half Life games. It launched before Portal, before TF2 was the king of the hill (hehe), before Left 4 Dead. Yet it still holds its own with these greats It\u2019s the characters in this game that stick with you. Alex is infinitely likable, and the game directors over at Valve know just how to exploit that likability to their storytelling advantage.\n\n[![2013-08-11_00037](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_000371-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_000371.jpg)\n\nThe puzzles are light adventure game-esque fare, with plenty of exploration of hatchways and ledges. As in previously Half Life games, I found myself always looking over my shoulder to see if I was being observed just out of reach. There\u2019s a spy novel\u2019s worth of alien subterfuge going on just below the surface of the Half Life series, and it\u2019s this ongoing story that really adds depth and additional replay value to the series.\n\nMeta comment: There\u2019s something about game reviewing that reminds me of \u2018Pokemon Snap\u2019. Not only are you playing through the game and trying to experience the story as intended, you\u2019re also looking at it from a photographer\u2019s viewpoint. \u201cThat\u2019ll make a great screenshot\u201d runs through my mind often. It\u2019s fun, but I wonder if it detracts from my immersion. \/end comment.\n\n[![2013-08-11_00045](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00045-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00045.jpg)\n\nThe gravity gun remains the center of the weapon rack, and it has received a nice upgrade from the previous game. You certainly feel like you are progressing, even if all your weapons have been stripped from you after the events of the HL2.\n\nImmediately after receiving the upgrade you\u2019re plunged into the heat of battle, and you find yourself flinging soldiers hundreds of feat into the air. It\u2019s a bit cartoonish, but it\u2019s also great fun.\n\n[![2013-08-11_00048](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00048-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00048.jpg)\n\nAlex is also a pleasure to interact with, never feeling like a weight like so many NPCs can. With her electronics toolkit, she actually feels like a useful contributor to the story-line beyond a romantic interest. That\u2019s always a plus.\n\n[![2013-08-11_00053](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00053-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00053.jpg)\n\nAll in all, this is still a terrific game. If you\u2019re on the fence and still haven\u2019t played it, bite the bullet and pick it up for a 5$. You\u2019ll be very happy you did. The developer\u2019s commentary alone makes it worth it, and there\u2019s some great character development that fans of the series shouldn\u2019t miss. 85%, a great showing even after all these years.\n\n[![specs](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>After the epic cliffhanger that was Half-Life 2, we were all waiting with baited breath to see what had happened to Gordon Freeman.

This is high drama, with well paced tension and regular action segments interspersed throughout.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00019.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00019-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-11_00019\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4326\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00019-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00019-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_00019.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In fact, it&#8217;s more than a few minutes before you get to any action.  The first 10-15 minutes is pure story-line, and excellently serves to draw you back into the dystopian world of Gordon Freeman.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar characters, engrossing world, and action game fun all blend masterfully into a brilliant, of short gaming experience.<\/p>\n<p>In a way, Half Life 2: Episode 1 is my favorite of the Half Life games.  It launched before Portal, before TF2 was the king of the hill (hehe), before Left 4 Dead.  Yet it still holds its own with these greats  It&#8217;s the characters in this game that stick with you.  Alex is infinitely likable, and the game directors over at Valve know just how to exploit that likability to their storytelling advantage.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_000371.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_000371-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-11_00037\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4327\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_000371-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_000371-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-11_000371.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The puzzles are light adventure game-esque fare, with plenty of exploration of hatchways and ledges.  As in previously Half Life games, I found myself always looking over my shoulder to see if I was being observed just out of reach.  There&#8217;s a spy novel&#8217;s worth of alien subterfuge going on just below the surface of the Half Life series, and it&#8217;s this ongoing story that really adds depth and additional replay value to the series.  <\/p>\n<p>Meta comment: There&#8217;s something about game reviewing that reminds me of &#8216;Pokemon Snap&#8217;.

This game included Half-Life 2: Episode 2, Portal, and Team Fortress 2 back before it was free. As each game was a stand-out game in its own right, I\u2019ll be reviewing all 3 separately. In this the first part, I\u2019ll be reviewing Half Life 2: Episode 2.\n\n[![2013-08-15_00007](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00007-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00007.jpg)\n\nIf you read my previous Half-Life 2 reviews, you\u2019ll know I\u2019m a fan of the series. The character development tends to be subtle and adds to gameplay. While the Orange Box only came out about 7 years ago, it already feels like an eternity and I hardly remember HL2:E2. I was obsessed with portal, which was a complete game changer for me. So I played through Ep 2 once or twice, and didn\u2019t give it much thought until now. I recall that like all the previous games in the series, it left me desperately hoping the next episode would come out soon. While I no longer hold out hope for a third episode, I do think a third Portal game is likely.\n\n[![2013-08-15_00018](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00018-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00018.jpg)\n\nAt any rate, I go into Episode 2 having played Episode 1 earlier last week. I don\u2019t have two years of anticipation coloring my expectations. I come into this review with a fairly clean palate. Once again the game begins with Alex, and a bit of a handy recap from last game. In a bit of a nod to Half Life 1, you\u2019re first moments are again on a train. This train however, is wrecked. This gives you your first interaction with Alex, and your first reminder of the beautiful outdoor visuals that became a hallmark of the second series of Half Life games.\n\n[![2013-08-15_00027](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00027-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00027.jpg)\n\nEpisode 2 still walks you through a \u2018game mechanics\u2019 tutorial, which seems a bit unnecessary but doesn\u2019t hinder the development of the plot. Gameplay progresses quickly as you fall into old patterns. \u201cUse the gravity gun to break boards.\u201d \u201cThrow explosive barrels at crab monsters.\u201d \u201cUse the gravity gun to put X into Y so Alex can fix a computer thing.\u201d Nothing new jumps out at first, but the story progresses at a healthy pace. While Episode 1 was all about interaction with your environment, Episode 2 is more about personal interaction. Much of the enjoyment of the game comes from the interaction of the NPCs between themselves. As you play the ever silent Gordon Freeman, the burden of character development rests solely on the dialog of the other characters. It\u2019s quite good, and features a fair bit of comedy. At this point your character and the NPCs have been interacting with each other for 3 games, and the easy banter makes for an enjoyable atmosphere of affable and occasionally dramatic interplay.\n\n[![2013-08-15_00034](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00034-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00034.jpg)\n\n> Do these levels feel familiar because I\u2019ve played them before, or because they\u2019ve been in every game since?\n\n[![2013-08-15_00037](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00037-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00037.jpg)\n\nEarly on, Alex is hurt and you must venture out in a bit of a convoluted escort mission. It starts to drag a bit, and I got turned around a few times. Considering the relatively short length of the game this is a bit of a shame, but it does give you an opportunity to get re-acquainted with your basic weapon set. This is how the game once again doles out weapons to you, rather than having you start the game with the weapons you finished Episode 2 with. Frankly this \u201close all your weapons ever episode\u201d game mechanic is starting to feel a little tired. It boils down to the same formula perfected in Half Life 1 (and perhaps long before).\n\n1. Give the player one (preferably non-lethal) tool.\n2. Give the player a crowbar\n3. Give the player a pistol\n4. Give the player a slightly better weapon, or a quieter one\n5. Repeat steps 3,4\n6. Finish the Game\n7. Lose All your weapons\n8. Go back to square 1\n\n[![2013-08-15_00041](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00041-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00041.jpg)\n\nLuckily, the designers of this game recognized the ubiquitousness of this game mechanic and sped it up to the span of a level or so. The same goes for the classic \u201ccave tunnel\u201d level, the \u2018last-ditch resistance\u2019 level, the \u2018sneak through an abandoned military facility\u2019 level, and so forth. There\u2019s even a bit of tower defense gameplay. It\u2019s almost as if Valve wanted to prove to everyone that they could make different types of games besides Half Life 2. In the years since, they\u2019ve certainly been adept and spinning off franchises in a variety of genres. Was Episode 2 the last hurrah of the Half Life series?\n\n[![2013-08-15_00010](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00010-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00010.jpg)\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to say this far out. Playing these games in 2013 still feels like you\u2019re playing a modern game. The graphics (especially inside buildings) are beginning to show their age. Some of the levels had me quite turned around. At least twice I was completely lost. This is a feeling that I\u2019ve long since lost while playing modern games. I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s a bad thing. It\u2019s just, it feels a bit anachronistic. With modern games tending towards automaps, compasses, and linear gameplay, a bit of confusion isn\u2019t so bad. Would a modern Half Life game still so dramatically affect the genre like the Half Life and Half Life 2 did?\n\n[![2013-08-15_00043](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00043-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00043.jpg)\n\nThe question really becomes, \u201cDo these levels feel familiar because I\u2019ve played them before, or because they\u2019ve been in every game since?\u201d That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a bad game, oh no. It\u2019s a great game. It\u2019s worth playing through simply for the rich interaction between the characters.\n\n[![2013-08-15_00046](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00046-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00046.jpg)\n\nSo if you\u2019re thinking about playing through Episode 2 for the first time, I\u2019d certainly not dissuade you. It\u2019s a great value along with Portal and TF2, and delivers the last great Half Life game to be released. I give the (presumably final) chapter in the Half Life: Episode 2 series a solid 80% B rating (by modern 2013 standards). It\u2019s a solid game that is just showing a few cracks with age. It doesn\u2019t bring anything new to the table that wasn\u2019t in Episode 1, but it\u2019s still a solid game. If you can still pick it up for a few $, it\u2019s definitely worth your time.\n\n[![2013-08-15_00042](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00042-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00042.jpg)\n\n[![specs](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>If you&#8217;ve been following along with my misadventures in game reviewing, you&#8217;ll know that the next game on my spreadsheet is the almighty Orange Box.

It&#8217;s worth playing through simply for the rich interaction between the characters.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00046.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00046-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-15_00046\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4362\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00046-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00046-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00046.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re thinking about playing through Episode 2 for the first time, I&#8217;d certainly not dissuade you.  It&#8217;s a great value along with Portal and TF2, and delivers the last great Half Life game to be released.  I give the (presumably final) chapter in the Half Life: Episode 2 series a solid 80% B rating (by modern 2013 standards).  It&#8217;s a solid game that is just showing a few cracks with age.  It doesn&#8217;t bring anything new to the table that wasn&#8217;t in Episode 1, but it&#8217;s still a solid game.  If you can still pick it up for a few $, it&#8217;s definitely worth your time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00042.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00042-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-15_00042\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4363\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00042-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00042-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00042.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png\" alt=\"specs\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4316\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png 250w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs-150x150.png 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs-50x50.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-15_00010.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 03:33:31 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 03:34:55 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 03:33:31 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4368,"title":"Steam Game Review #4 (Part 2): Team Fortress 2 (The Orange Box Part 2)","slug":"steam-game-review-4-part-2-team-fortress-2-the-orange-box-part-2","markdown":"\nI\u2019ve got a confession to make.

If you&#8217;re going it alone, expect to wade through a grade-school&#8217;s worth of kids.  That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s a mute button.  In my case, it&#8217;s a &#8220;don&#8217;t feel so damn old&#8221; button.  I would rate TF2 a solid 87% B+.  It&#8217;s got a few warts, and the community tends to be a little young, but it&#8217;s a fun and engrossing online FPS with a good amount of replayability and plenty of game types.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00011.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00011-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-17_00011\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4378\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00011-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00011-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00011.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png\" alt=\"specs\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4316\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png 250w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs-150x150.png 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs-50x50.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00002.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sat, 17 Aug 2013 22:19:55 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 17 Aug 2013 22:19:55 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 17 Aug 2013 22:19:55 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4381,"title":"Steam Game Review #4 (Part 3): Portal (The Orange Box Part 3)","slug":"steam-game-review-4-part-3-portal-the-orange-box-part-3","markdown":"\nI love this game.

The game that you should play if you\u2019re thinking about playing games after having been away for decades. First time gamers should play this.\n\n[![2013-08-17_00004](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_000041-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_000041.jpg)\n\nSo I go into this review heavily biased. I think everyone should own and play this game often, especially if you\u2019re in the industry. That said, here\u2019s my review of Portal.\n\n[![2013-08-17_00002](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_000021-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_000021.jpg)\n\nYou start off trapped in a cell. A tiny radio plays the portal ending theme in a tinny high-pitched precursor to the fun. You are a prisoner. The stark white walls blend into each other. You have no idea how big this place is. A robotic voice speaks to you over a loudspeaker. A portal opens, and you see yourself through the portal.\n\n[![2013-08-17_00008](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00008-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00008.jpg)\n\nThis is the first time you understand, portals bend space but not time. They are simply holes in space. Easy to understand when shown. Intuitive.\n\n[![2013-08-17_00009](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00009-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00009.jpg)\n\nI keep subtitles turned on for the purpose of reviews. GlaDos (the ever-creepier robotic voice) is written in a purple font. It\u2019s a throwback to the \u2018purple text for enemies\u2019 aesthetic of mid-80s adventure games. That\u2019s Portal. Lots of little things that many gamers might not notice the first or second or third time through. Lots of great dialog. Lots of greatness.\n\n[![2013-08-17_00012](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00012-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00012.jpg)\n\nIt starts out slow. You only have a blue portal gun. The puzzles are building, slowly. Your portal gun gets upgraded. You start to see cracks in the armor of the system. Things start to change. The puzzles get harder. You start to think in terms of gravity and momentum and movement arcs. Still GlaDos is ever present. Are you a lab rat? Are you trying to escape? Are you a freedom fighter? The story slowly builds around you, if you look for it.\n\n[![2013-08-17_00013](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00013-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00013.jpg)\n\nAs your creepy rapport builds with GlaDos, the stark testing facility atmosphere envelops you. You become this tester, running away from a homicidal robot voice that fixates on desserts. Long before Portal 2 developed the backstory, all that was there was what you pieced together from hidden rooms and snippets of dialog and graffiti. There was quite a bit of speculation as to how it all fit into the overall Half Life universe. If you\u2019re interested in the answers to those questions, I\u2019d recommend playing through Portal 1, then 2.\n\n[![2013-08-17_00015](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00015-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00015.jpg)\n\nAnd speaking of rapport, this game is full of excellent dialog. I find myself lingering extra long in the various puzzles, just to hear if GlaDos will say something snide. I destroy her cameras to hear her exasperation. I attempt to escape at all costs. I am the prisoner, the test taker, the lab rat. You cannot believe the lies, her lies, the lies of GlaDos. All belie hidden truths. All are mired in darkness, dripping in hatred. A cruel sense of humor permeates everything in the game. As each level loads, it goes deeper. You will get sucked into this game.\n\n[![2013-08-17_00016](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00016-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00016.jpg)\n\nIt\u2019s not a particularly long game either.

Believe me, it still holds up in 2013. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00017.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00017-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-17_00017\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4394\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00017-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00017-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_00017.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png\" alt=\"specs\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4316\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png 250w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs-150x150.png 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs-50x50.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-17_000011.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 18 Aug 2013 01:32:02 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 18 Aug 2013 01:32:02 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 18 Aug 2013 01:32:02 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4396,"title":"Indie Game Review #4: Bunny Must Die","slug":"indie-game-review-4-bunny-must-die","markdown":"\nI\u2019m plugging my controller in for this one.

Did you feel that you could have rolled through more levels, stuck to more things, gotten bigger more times?\n\n[![2013-08-18_00022](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00022-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00022.jpg)\n\nI know I did. So when The Wonderful End of The World was released, I had to have it. And honestly, it\u2019s pretty good. I\u2019ve played through it a couple times, and I\u2019m looking forward to this review. If you\u2019re looking for a TLDR it\u2019s this: If you liked Katamari you\u2019ll like this game.\n\n[![2013-08-18_00006](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00006-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00006.jpg)\n\nThat\u2019s the short of it. The long of it is a nod and an enhancement on a game idea set forth by Katamari. The ability to play on a PC (without an emulator) was one of the big reasons I purchased this game. It still works without complaint on my \u201csomewhat modern\u201d PC, so in that respect it\u2019s still a success.\n\n[![2013-08-18_00002](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00002-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00002.jpg)\n\nThe Wonderful End of The World (TWEoTW) is an indie-game take on Katamari Damacy. That means the overarching story isn\u2019t as cute as Katamari, and the soundtrack isn\u2019t quite as vibrant. I mean really, the Katamari Soundtrack was one of the best game soundtracks of all time. TWEoTW\u2019s soundtrack sort of fades into the background, which is fine. It\u2019s distinctive enough, and it doesn\u2019t mar the overall experience. It\u2019s adequate.\n\n[![2013-08-18_00012](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00012-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00012.jpg)\n\nThe game itself is amazing fun. It\u2019s perhaps a bit short, which is a complaint I had with Katamari as well. Perhaps these titles provide more difficult to program than people expect? Hard to say. Still there\u2019s something missing that I can\u2019t put my finger on. It could be the pervasive cruelty that subtly colors the interactions in Katamari. I continually receive A\u2019s and A+\u2019s in TWEoTW. The King of the Cosmos never gave me a score above \u201cawful.\u201d Somehow that was better? Weird. Anyway.\n\n[![2013-08-18_00007](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00007-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00007.jpg)\n\nThe level design is excellent. There\u2019s a retro level that will have you rolling up Pac Man, Tron, Centipede, Spy Hunter, and various other retro game characters (and level pieces, and vehicles, and floor tiles, etc.)\n\n[![2013-08-18_00019](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00019-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00019.jpg)\n\nThere\u2019s one level, I call it the \u201cScrabble Level\u201d as it reminds me greatly of swallowing up a set of scrabble pieces. Well, maybe a few sets along with a couple of sets of magnetic words. It\u2019s terrific fun, and it\u2019s one of my favorite levels of any game I\u2019ve played in this review series thus far.\n\n[![2013-08-18_00020](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00020-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00020.jpg)\n\nAt 9.99$, I\u2019d recommend upping to 14.99$ and getting the Dejoban games pack which includes the excellent \u2018Aahhh\u2019 (which is later on my games to review list). If you already have it, I\u2019d think about your love of Katamari. Do you want to play Katamari in many other levels and scenarios? If so, a 10$ bill for this game might not be a bad deal for you. I certainly got my money\u2019s worth out of this game. I\u2019d rate it a solid 88% B+. It\u2019s not as long as I\u2019d like but I do love it as a game. For me the scrabble level alone was worth it. It\u2019s a clone sure, but a clone that I could love.\n\n[![2013-08-18_00007](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00007-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00007.jpg)\n\n[![specs](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>Did you feel like Katamari Damacy was too short?

The long of it is a nod and an enhancement on a game idea set forth by Katamari.  The ability to play on a PC (without an emulator) was one of the big reasons I purchased this game.  It still works without complaint on my &#8220;somewhat modern&#8221; PC, so in that respect it&#8217;s still a success.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00002.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00002-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-18_00002\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4419\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00002-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00002.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Wonderful End of The World (TWEoTW) is an indie-game take on Katamari Damacy.  That means the overarching story isn&#8217;t as cute as Katamari, and the soundtrack isn&#8217;t quite as vibrant.  I mean really, the Katamari Soundtrack was one of the best game soundtracks of all time.  TWEoTW&#8217;s soundtrack sort of fades into the background, which is fine.  It&#8217;s distinctive enough, and it doesn&#8217;t mar the overall experience.  It&#8217;s adequate.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00012.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00012-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-18_00012\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4421\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00012-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-18_00012.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The game itself is amazing fun.  It&#8217;s perhaps a bit short, which is a complaint I had with Katamari as well.  Perhaps these titles provide more difficult to program than people expect?  Hard to say.  Still there&#8217;s something missing that I can&#8217;t put my finger on.  It could be the pervasive cruelty that subtly colors the interactions in Katamari.  I continually receive A&#8217;s and A+&#8217;s in TWEoTW.  The King of the Cosmos never gave me a score above &#8220;awful.&#8221;  Somehow that was better?  Weird.

I&#8217;d rate it a 70%.  For fans of 2d platformers and color-coded classics like Ikaruga it could be a must-buy, but for the casual gamer it&#8217;s a pass.  It has great visuals and a varied visual style, but no sense of storyline or direction.  For 4.99$ it&#8217;s easy to recommend to those well-versed in the difficult 2d-platforming world, but for everyone else It&#8217;s perhaps worth waiting till it comes up in another Humble Bundle.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/cheeky.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/cheeky-300x174.png\" alt=\"cheeky\" width=\"300\" height=\"174\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4434\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/cheeky-300x174.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/cheeky-1024x595.png 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/cheeky.png 1286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/dead.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 25 Aug 2013 03:09:46 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 25 Aug 2013 03:09:46 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 25 Aug 2013 03:09:46 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4439,"title":"Saints Row 4: Crackdown 3 is Here Today","slug":"saints-row-4-crackdown-3-is-here-today","markdown":"\nAfter a couple of evenings spent of playing Saints Row 4 it dawned on me.

So I\u2019ll lead with what I didn\u2019t like about the game. The single player mode was not nearly as strong as multiplayer. While there *were * some great gameplay elements in Crackdown, they were the most fun if you had a friend to play with. While hunting orbs in single player was ok (especially once you had your agility up to 5), the rest of the game could be kind of repetitive on single player. You quickly become an uber powerful superbeing, throwing cars and launching homing rockets with glee. Unfortunately, the gang leaders were often surrounded by hordes of headshot-loving guards. So there\u2019s the negative. It\u2019s not a single player experience that can really capture your attention like Saints Row 4 can (a game which I and many others have dubbed the true successor to Crackdown.)\n\n[![crackdown1](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/crackdown1-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/crackdown1.jpg)\n\nOnlive Multiplayer on the other hand was a wholly transformative experience (sadly there\u2019s no split screen). Lots of fun, no time limits, crazy weapons, open world. It takes everything that didn\u2019t work in single player and makes it better. When you take on those aforementioned headshot-loving guards with a friend and you inevitably die, your friend is still in the firefight. So they don\u2019t respawn, and you\u2019re in a race against time to return to the fight from your closest outpost.

Spawn a line of trucks and make a gravity catapult to throw cars over trucks. Grab the car that looks like a wedge and drive the wrong way down the highway at 100+mph, causing other vehicles to launch hundreds of feat into the air. The inter-city highway system was great too. Lots of enemy cars, lots of different AIs. Lots of times I would just sit on top of a car on the highway and let it drive me all around the cities while I blasted things with the rocket launcher. Your friends could be all over the city, having their own mini-adventures, searching for new weapons\/cars\/respawn points\/orbs\/bosses.\n\n[![crackdown3](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/crackdown3-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/crackdown3.jpg)\n\nThese games smartly set up the open city design with a varying level of difficulty between each \u2018quadrant\u2019. As such, you\u2019re \u201cgently\u201d encouraged (often with bullets) to stay out of heavier gang territory than you can currently handle.

I\u2019ve played through it in co-op mode at least 3 or 4 times. It\u2019s just laugh-out loud fun. The rag-doll physics make every explosion a treat.

This is long before I worked at a music game company. Long before Rock Band stopped making weekly releases. This was smack dab in the middle of Guitar Hero\u2019s popularity, 2008. I had seen previews for Audiosurf, a casual game where you fly through tracks created by your music. The idea of not paying $1.30 per song to enjoy some music sounded very appealing after having sunk way too much money into Guitar Hero content packs. Was it all that and a bag of chips?\n\n[![2013-08-25_00014](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00014-300x215.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00014.jpg)\n\nAudiosurf starts out simply enough. Select an MP3 file from your computer, and go. You start out flying through a 1000 foot view of the upcoming \u2018track\u2019 (pun intended, hehe.) The tempo and rhythm of each song translate into the hills and valleys that you\u2019ll be \u201cracing\u201d though. I say \u201cracing\u201d, but it\u2019s really more of a puzzle game ala Tetris.\n\n[![2013-08-25_00002](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00002-300x215.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00002.jpg)\n\nYes, Tetris. The various game modes have you sliding left and right while you barrel down the track, running into then depositing colored blocks into the various level-up slots that trail behind your vehicle.\n\n[![2013-08-25_00001](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00001-300x215.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00001.jpg)\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s not a good puzzle game, it\u2019s just not particularly deep. Each game mode is a small twist on the classic \u201ccollect-3\u201d format, and it adds a bit more meat to the thin broth that is Audiosurf\u2019s main gameplay mechanic.\n\n[![2013-08-25_00018](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00018-300x215.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00018.jpg)\n\nOn the other hand, a game doesn\u2019t have to be deep to be good. Five years later I still find myself loading up Audiosurf to play a quick round. It\u2019s not just about the gameplay (which isn\u2019t too much more than an interactive visualizer.) It\u2019s about the feedback. After each track you find out how well other people throughout the world did on that particular song. Finding out that you\u2019re not likely to ever be the first person to play through a song is a bit of a humbling experience to a music connoisseur. It\u2019s a reaffirmation really. There are other folks out there that share the same musical tastes as you, and they\u2019ve also shared the same gaming experience as you.\n\n[![2013-08-25_00016](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00016-300x215.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00016.jpg)\n\nIs that enough to recommend Audiosurf for purchase? That depends. Even if you like puzzle game mechanics and music-based gameplay, the 9.99 price tag is a tad hard to swallow. Considering this is a 5 year old game, I would have though the price would have dipped down to the 4.99 level permanently by now. It often comes up on weekend sale, and is a much easier recommendation at a discounted price. My rating? 80%. It\u2019s enjoyable fun that will keep you coming back every once in a while, but it\u2019s 5 years old and not quite meaty enough to still command the 10$ price tag.\n\n[![2013-08-25_00017](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00017-300x215.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00017.jpg)\n\n\n","html":"<p>Back in 2008 when Audiosurf was released, I was hungry for a music game.

Was it all that and a bag of chips?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00014.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00014-300x215.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-25_00014\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4455\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00014-300x215.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00014.jpg 859w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Audiosurf starts out simply enough.  Select an MP3 file from your computer, and go.  You start out flying through a 1000 foot view of the upcoming &#8216;track&#8217; (pun intended, hehe.)  The tempo and rhythm of each song translate into the hills and valleys that you&#8217;ll be &#8220;racing&#8221; though.  I say &#8220;racing&#8221;, but it&#8217;s really more of a puzzle game ala Tetris.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00002.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00002-300x215.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-25_00002\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4460\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00002-300x215.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00002.jpg 859w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Yes, Tetris.

Each game mode is a small twist on the classic &#8220;collect-3&#8221; format, and it adds a bit more meat to the thin broth that is Audiosurf&#8217;s main gameplay mechanic.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00018.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00018-300x215.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-25_00018\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4457\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00018-300x215.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00018.jpg 859w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, a game doesn&#8217;t have to be deep to be good.  Five years later I still find myself loading up Audiosurf to play a quick round.  It&#8217;s not just about the gameplay (which isn&#8217;t too much more than an interactive visualizer.)  It&#8217;s about the feedback.  After each track you find out how well other people throughout the world did on that particular song.  Finding out that you&#8217;re not likely to ever be the first person to play through a song is a bit of a humbling experience to a music connoisseur.  It&#8217;s a reaffirmation really.  There are other folks out there that share the same musical tastes as you, and they&#8217;ve also shared the same gaming experience as you.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00016.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00016-300x215.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-25_00016\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4458\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00016-300x215.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00016.jpg 859w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Is that enough to recommend Audiosurf for purchase?  That depends.  Even if you like puzzle game mechanics and music-based gameplay, the 9.99 price tag is a tad hard to swallow.  Considering this is a 5 year old game, I would have though the price would have dipped down to the 4.99 level permanently by now.  It often comes up on weekend sale, and is a much easier recommendation at a discounted price.  My rating?  80%.  It&#8217;s enjoyable fun that will keep you coming back every once in a while, but it&#8217;s 5 years old and not quite meaty enough to still command the 10$ price tag.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00017.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00017-300x215.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-25_00017\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4459\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00017-300x215.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00017.jpg 859w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-25_00014.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 02:07:54 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 02:07:54 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 02:07:54 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4464,"title":"PAX Prime: 2013","slug":"pax-prime-2013","markdown":"\nToday\u2019s the day.

I\u2019m done with Microsoft anyway. Nintendo\/Sony seem to have the right attitude towards Indie developers right now, so that\u2019s where\u2019s I\u2019m at.

Very short lines. Why? Indie game alley. There\u2019s a section of the convention devoted to my favorite segment of the game making populace I like to call Indie game alley. It reminds me of start-up alley, with each indie game developer pitching their wares. You buy the merch here rather than getting it for free like the rest of the convention, but you feel better about doing it than at Capcom\u2019s overpriced collectible store. Capcom did have some fairly unique\/cool items for sale in said store, but they all seemed a bit overpriced.\n\nSo I\u2019m in indie game alley, and I\u2019m playing an awesome game from a japanese developer about a couple of aliens who make soup. It\u2019s a co-op game, and you work to build robots to help you make soup to build larger factories that make soup and so on. The visual style was fun and the gameplay was a blast. It was a mix of terraria (mining blocks in 2d side-scrolling), and a simulation game like SimTower. There was another great game I was playing that was essentially an awesome anime version of asteriods. It had me hooked, but I noticed something. The controller had a touchpad on it\u2026 Wait a minute. Was this a PS4?\n\n[![20130830_134628](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_134628-225x300.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_134628.jpg)\n\nYep, it was. The developer of the game confirmed it, not that he needed to. The controller is pretty unique. I also began to realize that during the course of the day I\u2019d played on this controller a number of times. I played on a Nvidia Shield (and loved it.) I\u2019d also played on innumerable android and iOS devices. I used many Xbox 360 controllers, but they were all hooked up to PC towers. Never got close to an Xbone. I wasn\u2019t just playing indie games either, I was hitting all the heavy hitting studios, and I also played innumerable games I backed on Kickstarter.\n\n[![20130830_134553](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_134553-225x300.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_134553.jpg)\n\nOther standout games included Audiosurf 2 (awesome!), Saints Row 4 (I know, I know, I\u2019ve reviewed it already, but I got a free teeee-shhiirrrrrrt), Infamous: Second Son, a new Wolfenstein game, Stryder, and many many indie games. There were even a couple of fun rhythm based crossover games (rhythm dungeon crawler, rhythm space exploration, rhythm platformer, etc.) Oh and I set a world record for an upcoming Android pinball game. They gave me a ribbon. It was fun.\n\n[![20130830_144712](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_144712-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_144712.jpg)\n\nAnd the swag! I got a lot of great loot at PAX13.\n\n[![2013-08-30 20.33.55](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-20.33.55-225x300.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-20.33.55.jpg)\n\n8 Pinny Arcade pins, headbands, masks, a sweet Stryder scarf, a couple of very nice art booklets, lots of little trinkets and keychains, some great cards against humanity cards, and oodles of business cards(so many job offers, seriously if you\u2019re a programmer just head to PAX and mention what you do.)\n\n[![2013-08-30 20.34.20](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-20.34.20-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-20.34.20.jpg)\n\nI would heartily recommend PAX to anyone, of any age. There\u2019s so much to do, so much camaraderie.\n\n[![2013-08-30 20.34.03](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-20.34.03-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-20.34.03.jpg)\n\nAt one point during a \u201cpaint your own miniature and keep it\u201d giveway, I accidentally exploded a container of red paint all over 4 people (including myself.) One was about 15, and another was a heavily costumed cosplayer.\n\n[![2013-08-30 15.54.35](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-15.54.35-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-15.54.35.jpg)\n\nThey all just laughed it off, no big deal. PAX is about fun, and gaming together. The convention is littered with areas dedicated to various forms of multiplayer gaming. Sometimes I\u2019d be standing in line, the sound of the Super Mario theme coming through a wooden ocarina held by a very good Link cosplayer. It would all just click. So many people. Everyone gaming, having a good time, being positive. By the end of the day I was exhausted but elated, covered in buttons, weighed down with swag. If you can, you should go.\n\n[![2013-08-30 16.51.17](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-16.51.17-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-16.51.17.jpg)\n\n\n","html":"<p>Right off the bat I have to say, PAX was a blast.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_104606.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_104606-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"20130830_104606\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4480\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_104606-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_104606-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This was my first year, and I wasn&#8217;t 100% sure what to expect from such a large gaming convention.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_1102241.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_1102241-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"20130830_110224\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4475\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_1102241-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_1102241-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>What struck me, so many times, was that this group of people wasn&#8217;t any different (save for the cosplayers) than any random group of people I see in my office building every day.

I wasn&#8217;t just playing indie games either, I was hitting all the heavy hitting studios, and I also played innumerable games I backed on Kickstarter.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_134553.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_134553-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"20130830_134553\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4482\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_134553-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_134553-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Other standout games included Audiosurf 2 (awesome!), Saints Row 4 (I know, I know, I&#8217;ve reviewed it already, but I got a free teeee-shhiirrrrrrt), Infamous: Second Son, a new Wolfenstein game, Stryder, and many many indie games.

Everyone gaming, having a good time, being positive.  By the end of the day I was exhausted but elated, covered in buttons, weighed down with swag.  If you can, you should go.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-16.51.17.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-16.51.17-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-30 16.51.17\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4472\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-16.51.17-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-30-16.51.17-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/20130830_104606.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sat, 31 Aug 2013 04:34:33 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 31 Aug 2013 04:34:33 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 31 Aug 2013 04:34:33 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4486,"title":"Indie Game Review #6: Chime","slug":"indie-game-review-6-chime","markdown":"\n[![2013-08-31_00001](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00001-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00001.jpg)\n\nNow here\u2019s something that\u2019s never happened to me before. I launch Desura, and install Chime. Upon going to launch Chime from within Desura, I get a popup stating that I must register the product on Steam before playing. I guess they use Steam for their account activation functionality. It felt pretty strange though, to be told to launch Steam from Desura.\n\n[![chimesteam](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/chimesteam-300x113.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/chimesteam.png)\n\nAt any rate, I got the game on Desura, but I\u2019ll be playing it through Steam. Launching the game through the Desura launcher just punts me over to Steam. Strange.\n\n[![2013-08-31_00004](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00004-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00004.jpg)\n\nSo here is Chime. As you may know from my PAX wrap-up post, rhythm games are back into fashion. This is great, as they\u2019re one of my favorite genres. That could be because I\u2019m terrible at them, but that doesn\u2019t detract from my enjoyment of the genre, much like Street Fighter.\n\n[![2013-08-31_00005](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00005-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00005.jpg)\n\nSo Chime is in a very large part a Lumines clone, but with some very interesting twists. While the basic gameplay mechanic from lumines remains (groups of blocks clearing as a musical meter drags across the screen), that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\n[![2013-08-31_00006](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00006-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00006.jpg)\n\nYour goal is to change as much of each map to another color as possible (think Q-Bert.) You do this via clearing away groups of blocks that you drop ala Lumines. As with Lumines, the music really affects the quality of gameplay.\n\n[![2013-08-31_00017](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00017-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00017.jpg)\n\nLuckily the music here is great, even featuring everyone\u2019s favorite Portal song as a last level treat. Each block that clears adds a little twang or guitar riff to the overall musical landscape, and it serves to immerse you into the song.\n\n[![2013-08-31_00019](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00019-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00019.jpg)\n\nUnfortunately, you had better love those few songs. Like Tetris before it, this is a game with a very minimal set of songs. While they tend to be great songs, there are only 6 of them. So you can play through the first iteration of the game in just under an hour or so.\n\n[![2013-08-31_00008](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00008-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00008.jpg)\n\nAdditional gameplay time comes from replaying these levels to get higher scores, or playing infinitely in free play mode. If you\u2019re a big fan of Lumines and Tetris these modes may appeal to you, but I just wasn\u2019t feeling it. Once I beat a game, unless the story is really compelling I tend not to play through it again. So for me, I got 6 levels and 1 hour of gameplay for a couple of bucks. Not bad, but I\u2019ve done much better.\n\n[![2013-08-31_00018](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00018-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00018.jpg)\n\nThe standard 5$ price tag seems a bit high to me, but this game is often included in the many bundles that fly around nowadays. If you can pick it up for a buck or two and you\u2019re a fan of the genre, I\u2019d say jump on it. The two hours I played were quite enjoyable, and it\u2019s cheaper than a matinee movie ticket. I\u2019d rate it 75%. While the gameplay and originality of the game made me want to rate it much higher, the extremely short duration dropped the score significantly.\n\n[![specs](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00001.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00001-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-31_00001\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4489\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00001-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00001-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00001.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now here&#8217;s something that&#8217;s never happened to me before.

Not bad, but I&#8217;ve done much better. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00018.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00018-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-08-31_00018\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4496\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00018-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00018-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00018.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The standard 5$ price tag seems a bit high to me, but this game is often included in the many bundles that fly around nowadays.  If you can pick it up for a buck or two and you&#8217;re a fan of the genre, I&#8217;d say jump on it.  The two hours I played were quite enjoyable, and it&#8217;s cheaper than a matinee movie ticket.  I&#8217;d rate it 75%.  While the gameplay and originality of the game made me want to rate it much higher, the extremely short duration dropped the score significantly.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png\" alt=\"specs\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4316\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png 250w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs-150x150.png 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs-50x50.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-08-31_00006.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sat, 31 Aug 2013 18:08:17 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 31 Aug 2013 18:08:17 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 31 Aug 2013 18:08:17 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4498,"title":"Game Reviews Going Multi-Platform, 187 New Games Added To Review List","slug":"game-reviews-going-multi-platform-187-new-games-added-to-review-list","markdown":"\nI figure I\u2019m already at 1000, what\u2019s another 200?

The game was Doom.**\n\n[![TITLE](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/TITLE-300x198.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/TITLE.png)\n\nI was but 12 years old. I had received the shareware diskette of Doom from a gaming magazine, and it was about to change my life.\n\nYou see, I had never played Wolfenstein. Before Doom I had mostly played King\u2019s Quest and Scumm type games on my parents 386 pc (or Gold Box games for C64 further back.) This was to be the disk that brought so many first for me.\n\n[![images](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/images.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/images.jpg)\n\n**This was my first time paying for shareware.**  \n I was but 12, but I knew I had to have the full version of Doom. I had played through the demo disk levels (3.5\u2033 floppy) so many times I was ready for the full experience. I wanted to see THE SPIDER DEMON. I remember that being a big thing. Back before everyone had the internet your gaming knowledge came from magazines, word of mouth, and the guys at the checkout counter at the software store. So I knew I wanted to beat the spider demon, but I had no idea what it was all about. And when I got there? Totally worth it.\n\n**This was my first mail-away game purchase, and the first software purchase not made at a big-box software store (remember Software Etc?)**  \n When I was growing up I was quite cash poor. I would save for months and years on end to purchase NES games (or SCUMM games from Lucasarts for my parents 386 PC), which I would play again and again. Weekly. Daily. For years. So games were very important to me growing up. They helped an emotionally fragile boy acclimatize to a young life of constant transition. New school, new friends, same games. My one constant. My games.\n\nThat means that every dollar had to count. I had to know, for certain, that if I were stranded on a desert island I could play this game for the rest of my life. The shareware portion of Doom had lived up to that high expectation, and I was sure the full game would as well.\n\n[![abiance](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/abiance-300x221.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/abiance.png)\n\n**This was my first time installing a mod.**  \n Back when I was 12, I had only ever programmed in Basic. I was good at math, and knew all about DOS and how to navigate the file system, but I had no knowledge of what when into games. Decades before I wrote games for a living I dreamed of what it would be like to write games. The power to create anything, change anything. Doom was my first dip into that swirling pool of freedom.\n\nI remember very clearly playing through the entire game with a Dragonball mod enabled that would change the sound effects and graphics to be from the Dragonball anime series. This was so mind blowing to me back in the mid-nineties. I was awestruck, completely absorbed in the game. That\u2019s the feeling we all strive for in gaming. Complete immersion. Living in the moment. That was Doom.\n\n[![Capture](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/Capture-300x245.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/Capture.png)\n\nDoom Levels was my first CD-ROM Add ON Purchase  \n Again back before most of us had the Internet things were quite different. If you wanted a set of mods or user created content levels for a game, you\u2019d either have to:\n\n1. Find a gaming magazing that included the CD\nor\n\n3. Buy a pre-packaged product that simply repackaged free content and sold it at a premium.\n\n[![map](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/map-300x223.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/map.png)\n\nI took the latter route. In 1994 or 1995 I purchased a set of 900 modded and homebrew levels for Doom on a CD-ROM. One of these levels was Star Wars themed, and it set off my love affair with Star Wars FPS games. This was shortly before Dark Forces came out, because I remember thinking that the designers of Dark Forces had just \u201cripped off\u201d the user created levels when I heard about the game from a friend. Months later when I finally had a shareware copy of the game in my hand I realized how wrong I had been, but news and games travelled slowly back then.\n\n[![stophittingme](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/stophittingme-300x222.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/stophittingme.png)\n\n**This was the first PC game I replayed more than 5 times.**  \n I had played through and beaten Kings Quest 5 and 6 a couple of times I had played through most of the SCUMM games a couple of times. I thought I knew what was up with PC gaming. I had no idea what was coming. Doom, with it\u2019s strong modding community, creepy atmosphere, and life-altering \u201c3D\u201d FPS gameplay kept me drawn in for a long, long time.\n\n**This was my first FPS experience.**  \n Somehow I had missed the boat on Wolfenstein 3d. I imagine my parents didn\u2019t want me running around playing \u201cNazi Killer.\u201d At any rate, when I first sat down to play Doom I was transfixed. I hadn\u2019t yet played Eye of the Beholder or Ravenloft. I hadn\u2019t yet played faceball 2000 or Flight Simulator. I had only played a few PC games, and nothing like this. This wasn\u2019t anything like what I had played on my NES. This was new, transformative. This was the future of gaming. The fuse that lit a ten year explosion of FPS gaming.\n\nSo here\u2019s my review.\n\nHow does Doom (1993) hold up in 2013?\n\nPretty well, but not in the way that you\u2019d think. Doom has become, almost cutesy. Howso?\n\nFirst off the ambiance. What used to be shocking (Satanic symbols in video games! Red Pixels!) now seems quite retro and harmless. 20 years have not been kind to Doom\u2019s \u201cfear factor\u201d.\n\nSecondly, the sounds are laughably bad by today\u2019s standards. You\u2019ve got about 10 of them total, and most of the soldiers death sounds remind me of cow grunts.\n\n[![bloodymess](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/bloodymess-300x230.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/bloodymess.png)\n\nFinally, the inability to aim up or down makes the game feel laughably dated. You\u2019re literally aiming on a 2D plane.\n\nLuckily the game makes up for it by being a blisteringly fast thrill ride\u2026 most of the time. The fact that you\u2019re only aiming on a 2D plane means you\u2019ll be hitting your targets twice as fast. Those cow grunts start to become a herd when the enemies are coming fast and furious, and those are sounds that you\u2019ll never forget. Doom, no matter how quaint it seems today, is an experience that you take with you forever.\n\n[![kellkeep](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/kellkeep-300x217.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/kellkeep.png)\n\nI attempted to locate the seemingly mythical Dragonball Doom mod I played oh so many years ago. Getting ahold of these mods is now made quite a bit more difficult, as many of them were apparently hosted on Geocities. Ugh. Thankfully [ModDB had it](http:\/\/www.moddb.com\/games\/doom\/downloads\/dragonball-doom) up with a free DOOM clone, so no need to purchase the game if you\u2019re only planning to relive some classic mods.\n\n[![dbzdoom1](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/dbzdoom1-300x232.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/dbzdoom1.png)\n\nThere\u2019s certainly less hand-holding than in modern games. If you die, you die, and your weapons are gone. You respawn instantly, and move at about 60mph on foot. It makes for an incredibly fast paced, fluid experience that shouldn\u2019t be missed by the modern gamer. While the 14.99$ price for the Doom classic pack seems grossly overpriced, it often goes on sales of up to 80% off on Steam. For 4-5$, this is a seminal gaming experience that you shouldn\u2019t miss out on because of its dated aesthetic. I\u2019d still rate it an 80% in 2013, a classic experience even for modern gamers.\n\n\n","html":"<p><strong>The year was 1993.

I&#8217;d still rate it an 80% in 2013, a classic experience even for modern gamers.  <\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/TITLE.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 01 Sep 2013 16:26:38 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 01 Sep 2013 16:26:38 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 01 Sep 2013 16:26:38 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4543,"title":"Indie Game Review #7: Cute Things Dying Violently","slug":"indie-game-review-7-cute-things-dying-violently","markdown":"\n[![title](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title-300x174.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title.png)\n\nCute Things Dying Violently (CTDV) is a bloody mix of Angry Birds and Lemmings.\n\n[![instructions](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/instructions-300x174.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/instructions.png)\n\nThe premise of CTDV is easy enough to understand. \u201cFlick\u201d your creatures up to the goal post by selecting them and dragging a \u201cslingshot\u201d away from them. That\u2019s where the Angry Birds gameplay comes in. Anyone who has played one of the Angry Birds series will be intimately familiar with this mechanic.

As you\u2019re flicking your creatures towards the goal, or various puzzle elements, you\u2019ll naturally miss.

Perhaps that\u2019s the point, but I think the game can easily stand on it\u2019s own merits. Your creatures could just \u2018pop\u2019 and disappear and it wouldn\u2019t detract anything from the gameplay. What it would detract from perhaps, is its marketability to an audience who isn\u2019t likely to purchase an angry birds game, but may purchase a game where extreme violence is inferred from the title and promotional material. It\u2019s a Trojan horse, but an unnecessary one. The game has plenty of visual flair, and I almost wonder of the buckets-of-blood aspect was added at a later date, after the game was nearing completion. Drench an almost-finished puzzle game in enough blood and sell it on branding alone, then hope they get hooked on the gameplay and come back for more.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s a bit jaded. I know this is a fresh developer, looking to break in and make a name. It was a bold move, and it worked. I would just like to believe that it wasn\u2019t necessary. That the game could have stood out simply via a fresh take on the \u2018fling-a-thing\u2019 genre. That we live in a world where marketing isn\u2019t everything, and people care about ideas. That there\u2019s a benevolent mass of Kick-starting, open-sourcing, thing-flinging puzzle junkies who would have bought the game without the exploding animals.

I\u2019d rate it a 75%. While rough around the edges, it still provides enough variety and gameplay to keep you coming back. The addition of a level editor adds further value and the ability to create some truly devious levels, if that\u2019s your thing. If you\u2019re on the fence and hesitant to fork out 2.99$ for an (extremely modified) Angry Birds variant, you can also still pick it up for an very budget friendly 1$ on Xbox Live Arcade.\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title-300x174.png\" alt=\"title\" width=\"300\" height=\"174\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4545\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title-300x174.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title-1024x595.png 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title.png 1286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Cute Things Dying Violently (CTDV) is a bloody mix of Angry Birds and Lemmings.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/instructions.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/instructions-300x174.png\" alt=\"instructions\" width=\"300\" height=\"174\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4547\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/instructions-300x174.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/instructions-1024x595.png 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/instructions.png 1286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The premise of CTDV is easy enough to understand.  &#8220;Flick&#8221; your creatures up to the goal post by selecting them and dragging a &#8220;slingshot&#8221; away from them.

They Bleed Pixels is most certainly a harder game, but it gives you the option of setting a checkpoint whenever your super meter fills up. This means you can drop a save point immediately before a difficult platforming section. In Volgarr, you restart from the beginning of the level. Not only that, but you restart from the beginning of the GAME every time you play.

Perhaps it was a sign of the ever-changing social mores of the gaming public, but Doom II feels more self-aware than the original Doom.

The ones they don\u2019t print on the box, but everyone knows by heart after many hours of play. The real knowledge that is gained from gameplay.\n\n**Rule #1: Nothing Comes For Free**  \n If you\u2019re walking along and you see some free armor, you for sure know that\u2019s going to trip a switch and send some hellspawn your way. You don\u2019t just get free armor! Come on man, what are you thinking!  \n[![supershotgun](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/supershotgun-300x283.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/supershotgun.png)\n\n**Rule #2: Fortune Favors the Bold**  \n If you\u2019re looking to discover all that Doom II has to offer, then you\u2019ll want to have as many weapons as possible, and early. The best way to do this is to seek out groups of enemies to kill. You\u2019ll often find a switch or a secret wall nearby. It\u2019s a finely crafted feedback loop. Find weapons, use weapons to mow down hellspawn, find better weapons. Feeling a little wimpy? Go searching for a group of enemies. Counter-intuitive yet it works.  \n[![death](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/death-300x245.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/death.png)\n\n**Rule #3: Save Your Game, but Not To The Detriment of Fun**  \n You can save your game at any time. There is no restriction on when you can save whatsoever. Save during a game over screen if you want. However, there is a point beyond which you are taking away something vital from this game. You\u2019re supposed to die. You\u2019re supposed to get frustrated, get better, learn from your mistakes. If you\u2019re just quick-loading a few seconds prior to every death you\u2019re not learning anything. You\u2019re missing the point.  \n[![map](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/map1-300x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/map1.png)\n\nThat said, (and this segways nicely into rule 4), after your first playthrough this is a great way to work on your speedrun time.\n\n**Rule #4 (My Favorite): This is Your Game, and Your Are Encouraged to Hack and Cheat**  \n There is no \u2018cheat console\u2019 in Doom II. You just type in a cheat and it happens. There\u2019s one level that\u2019s done up like the original Wolfenstein that you can only get to via cheat code. Cheat codes, for many, were a way of extending gameplay and adding a new level of fun to a game you\u2019ve played through. They are also an alternate way of providing a \u2018very easy\u2019 mode. Doom II also follows the original Doom in that there are countless mods, maps, weapon packs, and total conversions for Doom II that you can still find today. As Id software long ago released the engine source code for Doom II, you don\u2019t even need to purchase the game to play these. Gotta love open source.  \n[![bonuslevelcheat](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/bonuslevelcheat-300x289.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/bonuslevelcheat.png)\n\n**So is Doom II Worth 5$ in 2013?**  \n If you\u2019ve played the original Doom on Steam, it\u2019s likely Doom II: Hell on Earth was also included in that purchase. So for that segment of my readers, the question becomes \u201cis Doom II worth playing?\u201d and not \u201cis Doom II worth buying?\u201d That\u2019s an easier question. Of course Doom II is worth playing! It\u2019s Doom on steroids with a bit of extra mirth. So play it.  \n[![cheating](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/cheating-300x295.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/cheating.png)\n\nFor everyone else asking is Doom II worth buying? Yes. If you\u2019re a fan of the genre, it\u2019s a must own. The graphics may be dated, but the gameplay, pacing, and overall level of fun are timeless. A solid 80%, even all these years later. Pick it up in a bundle with the rest of the Id software classics for extra savings and many hours of good times.  \n[![specs](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>Hell has returned to earth!

I have literally put hundreds of generations worth of characters through the remorseless grind. I have died hundreds of times, spent millions of dollars, killed thousands of monsters. I have loved every minute of it.\n\n[![2013-09-22_00013](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00013-300x180.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00013.jpg)\n\nRogue Legacy is a combination of Castlevania, Metroid, and Rogue. Death is permanent, but you pass on your wisdom and wealth to your offspring. Each hero has their own traits, both negative and positive, and each playthough is therefore colored (sometimes literally) by the abilities of the hero. Perhaps you\u2019ll be colorblind, perhaps bald. Each character (each life, essentially) is a new chance and a fresh take on the adventure.\n\n[![2013-09-22_00009](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00009-300x180.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00009.jpg)\n\nYou start out in an empty castle. As you slowly explore this castle, you find harder enemies. More devious traps. More difficult bosses. You slowly unlock weapons and spells and stat increases. This is a game that knows how to slowly dole out excellent bonuses for you.\n\n[![2013-09-22_00003](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00003-300x180.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00003.jpg)\n\nAfter a few hours of play you\u2019ll think you have a handle on how the game is going to be played. After a few dozen, you\u2019re just starting to get it. Slowly upgrade, but be thoughtful. Every purchased upgrade increases the cost of all future upgrades. Things get expensive.\n\n[![2013-09-22_00002](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00002-300x180.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00002.jpg)\n\nEvery generation yields a new hero, a new chance at success. A new, almost inevitably dead hero. These characters are born with one foot in the grave. You will die, a lot.\n\n[![2013-09-22_00006](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00006-300x180.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00006.jpg)\n\nAfter many, many hours of play you learn some things. There are a few tips I can pass on, to those who would embark on this quest.\n\n1. Flight is awesome, but not required for gameplay.  \n Seriously, every time you get a flight rune you\u2019ll be tempted to equip it. Eventually you\u2019ll be able to fly for many seconds, but you\u2019ll also likely realize you\u2019re not getting any further. Flight is a red herring, and almost always not necessary for gameplay.\n\n[![2013-09-22_00007](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00007-300x180.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00007.jpg)\n\n2. Up your Health, Armor, and Attack first, and often.  \n While the other power-ups are great (a chance not to die!), nothing beats these basic three upgrades.\n\n[![2013-09-22_00004](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00004-300x180.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00004.jpg)\n\n3. Vampirism will carry you through 20 hours of midgame, but at some point you have to let it go.  \n Seriously. The end-game is all about beating the bosses and unlocking the final secret of the castle. This means vampirism is not useful at all.

Hokage really is the best of all Ninja.  \n Naruto was right. It\u2019s great to be Hokage. Your massive attack power is rivaled by none, and your special abilities verge on game-breaking.

I\u2019ve been playing and re-playing it for months and I can easily see myself clearing out another hundred castles in my quest to unlock all that Rogue Legacy has to offer. An extremely solid offering, and a new classic that we\u2019ll all be playing for many years to come. I rate Rogue Legacy a 98%, A+, terrific fun, and a terrific value at around 10-15$ depending on your territory.\n\n[![specs](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/specs.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00008.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00008-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"2013-09-22_00008\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4594\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00008-300x180.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00008-1024x614.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00008.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>First and foremost, Rogue Legacy is an instant classic.

Perhaps you&#8217;ll be colorblind, perhaps bald.

There are a few tips I can pass on, to those who would embark on this quest.  <\/p>\n<p>1.  Flight is awesome, but not required for gameplay.<br \/>\nSeriously, every time you get a flight rune you&#8217;ll be tempted to equip it.  Eventually you&#8217;ll be able to fly for many seconds, but you&#8217;ll also likely realize you&#8217;re not getting any further.  Flight is a red herring, and almost always not necessary for gameplay.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00007.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00007-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"2013-09-22_00007\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4591\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00007-300x180.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00007-1024x614.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00007.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>2.  Up your Health, Armor, and Attack first, and often.<br \/>\nWhile the other power-ups are great (a chance not to die!), nothing beats these basic three upgrades.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00004.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00004-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"2013-09-22_00004\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4592\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00004-300x180.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00004-1024x614.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00004.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>3.  Vampirism will carry you through 20 hours of midgame, but at some point you have to let it go.<br \/>\nSeriously.  The end-game is all about beating the bosses and unlocking the final secret of the castle.  This means vampirism is not useful at all.  Your vampirism runes, upgrades, and armor pieces mean nothing in the end game.  Be prepared to switch up your strategy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00005.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00005-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"2013-09-22_00005\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4593\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00005-300x180.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00005-1024x614.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-22_00005.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>4.

After a few hours of play, and a few more hours of relaxing, I realized that I hadn\u2019t written an article about Android in a while. I also haven\u2019t updated [The Grind](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.thegrind) in a while, which is a shame because it\u2019s one of my favorite casual games and also one of my more popular ones.\n\nSo, I decided to update The Grind with Achievements and Leaderboards using the new Google Play Services framework. As with all of my apps and games, this is fully [open sourced on GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/The_Grind) (BSD licensed) so you can use the code, icons, graphics, and ideas however you wish.\n\n**Prerequisites**  \n Before you do anything, you\u2019ll need to have a Google Developer account, and a working knowledge of Android\/Java programming. Feel free to [go through](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis) the ~70 android apps I\u2019ve open sourced on GitHub to brush up on things.\n\n[![gitthub](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/gitthub-300x164.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/gitthub.png)\n\nFollow the [Google Player Services setup guide](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/google\/play-services\/setup.html), and make sure your project can be built with the play services \u2018library project\u2019 referenced.\n\nNow, clone the [\u2018basegameutils\u2019](https:\/\/github.com\/playgameservices\/android-samples) library for an easier time implementing your auth flow.\n\n**Setting Up Your Game Details On Google Play**\n\nGo through the text-heavy Google Play Developer Console \u201cGame Services\u201d setup and enter all your app information.\n\n[![gamedetails](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/gamedetails-300x162.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/gamedetails.png)\n\nYou can import most of your information from an existing listing, if you have one.\n\n[![gamedetails](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/gamedetails-300x162.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/gamedetails.png)\n\nWhen you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ll also need to grab your generated app ID from the developer console or API console and append it to your metadata app tag in AndroidManifest.xml\n\n[![gameservices](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/gameservices-300x199.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/gameservices.png)\n\n**Choosing your Achievements**\n\n[![newachievement](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/newachievement-300x162.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/newachievement.png)\n\nAlways make sure you throw in at least one Spaceballs reference.\n\n[![spaceballs](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/spaceballs-300x162.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/spaceballs.png)\n\n**Creating your Icons**  \n One of the great things about Wikipedia Commons is the vast troves of images which are available for unlicensed use. If you\u2019re not a great artist and you wish to create an armor icon, why not base it off a public domain image of a real piece of 15th century armor?\n\n[![armorup](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/armorup1-253x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/armorup1.png)\n\n[![armorup](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/armorup-300x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/armorup.png)\n\n**Creating a Leaderboard \u2013 Google Play Authentication**\n\nFor any of this to work, you\u2019re going to need to link it to your Google Play account. That means you\u2019ll need to implement sign-in related functions in your app.\n\nDerive from \u2018BaseGameActivity\u2019, then add the following methods:\n\n```\n<br><\/br>\n    @Override<br><\/br>\n    public void onSignInFailed() {```\n\n }\n\n @Override  \n public void onSignInSucceeded() {\n\n }\n\nDepending on your game design, you may or may not need to actually implement anything in the above methods.\n\n**Hooking Up Your Leaderboard In Your Game**  \n The developer documents are always a good reference, and the Leaderboard docs (though sparse) should still be your first stop when looking to code up a feature. Google has made it very easy to implement this functionality. Your leaderboard is essentially just a large integer table.

A bit of cleanup and you\u2019ve got my latest find, Pac Man 2: The New Adventures for the Sega Genesis. Was it worth the dollar I paid?\n\n[![2013-09-24 18.35.58](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-24-18.35.58-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-24-18.35.58.jpg)\n\nFor the purpose of generating a review, perhaps it was. Was the gameplay worth a dollar? *No*, **it was not**. Frankly what you expect for 1$ isn\u2019t much different from what you expect from 10$. You expect to enjoy yourself, for a little while at least. And honestly, I did enjoy myself for a little while. But then the pain set in, and the anger.\n\n[![apples](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/apples-300x238.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/apples.png)\n\nThis game would feel right at home on a tablet. You\u2019re never interacting with Pac Man directly, you\u2019re only firing various bullets to get his attention. This is a game mechanic that came to prominence almost 20 years later, and for a reason. 20 years later we had the appropriate hardware to interact with an environment full of objects in an intuitive way. A genesis controller isn\u2019t the best way to interact in this way. That\u2019s not so bad though, it\u2019s just a bit clunky.\n\n[![cap1](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/cap1-300x245.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/cap1.png)\n\nHonestly if that were the only thing working against this game it would be a pretty decent nostalgia trip. The cartoony graphics hold up well even two decades later.

The killer is Pac Man himself. He ignores you. He may as well be following his own script. The game is at its core a variation of the point-and-click adventure game. You click through objects, attempt to point Pac Man into various situations, and watch as Pac Man does his thing. It would almost be a linear experience, if it wasn\u2019t so frustrating. It\u2019s like the game designers had grandiose visions of an artificially intelligent Pac Man. Perhaps too they actually created a truly intelligent being. Sadly, the one they created is a bit of an asshole. This game could have been a fun and inventive take on the console point and click, instead it was a dismal stain on Namco\u2019s good brand.

You&#8217;re never interacting with Pac Man directly, you&#8217;re only firing various bullets to get his attention.  This is a game mechanic that came to prominence almost 20 years later, and for a reason.  20 years later we had the appropriate hardware to interact with an environment full of objects in an intuitive way.  A genesis controller isn&#8217;t the best way to interact in this way.

There does appear to be a pattern, though I won\u2019t ruin it for any of your crypto nuts.\n\n[![password](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/password1-300x279.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/password1.png)\n\nEach of the levels is loosely based on the street fighter character you\u2019re going up against. The music is spot on 80s Mega Man mixed with some classic Capcom aesthetic.  \n If you feel at home playing Mega Man, you\u2019ll feel right at home here.\n\n[![beepbeep](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/beepbeep-300x271.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/beepbeep.png)\n\nEach boss is a charming 8-bit representation of a Street Fighter character. Oh how I wish Darkstalkers was as popular as Street Fighter, but I digress. The boss fights are well done, and enjoyable.\n\n[![blanka](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/blanka-300x271.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/blanka.png)\n\nAfter each boss fight, you\u2019ll learn that characters secret move. Everyone\u2019s favorite punching bag Dan shows up after each bout to help you practice. It\u2019s a great touch in a game full of great touches.\n\n[![dan](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/dan-300x271.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/dan.png)\n\nThe attention to detail really sets this apart from most fan games I\u2019ve played. There are a ton of little moments that all add up to an engrossing Mega Man experience. When Chun-Li reflects your bullet, the camera zooms in on her hands, creating a close-up cinematic effect. The first time it happened to me I audibly said \u201cwoah\u201d, immediately followed by \u201cthis is awesome\u201d.\n\n[![chunli](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/chunli-300x271.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/chunli.png)\n\nThat sort of sums up this game. It\u2019s free. The nostalgia factor is off the charts. It may as well be an official Mega Man game for how well it is done.

I rate it a 91%, excellent, and a new classic.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs.png\" alt=\"specs\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4654\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs.png 250w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs-150x150.png 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs-50x50.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/tough.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 03:07:44 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 03:07:44 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 03:07:44 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4693,"title":"Review: Doom 3 + Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil","slug":"review-doom-3-doom-3-resurrection-of-evil","markdown":"\nThe year was 2005, and it was spring. I had been working at my first post-graduate programming job for about 2 years, and my PC was an aging Pentium-3 600. My graphics card, a Geforce TNT-2 that had managed to sustain me on (very) light gaming until then. It was time for an upgrade. Why? Doom 3 was coming out.\n\n[![2013-09-29_00004](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00004-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00004.jpg)\n\nAs you may know from my previous articles, I was big into [Doom](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2013\/09\/01\/steam-game-review-7-doom-1993\/) and [Doom 2](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2013\/09\/22\/review-doom-ii-hell-on-earth\/) back when they were released in the 90s. Then again, in the 90s I lived far into the country, had few friends, fewer dollars, and way too much spare time. Doom 3 was released almost a decade later, when I lived in the city with my future wife, already had my first degree and a good job, and precious little spare time. Did Doom 3 deliver on the ten year wait?\n\n[![2013-09-29_00015](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00015-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00015.jpg)\n\nHell yeah it did(pun intended.) Doom 3 was a tour-de-force, and the motivation behind a generation of pc upgrades. Doom 3 itself sold three million copies, and who knows how many millions (billions?) of dollars were spent on the pc components necessary to run it. To REALLY max out Doom 3 was impossible with the hardware of the day (for about a year or so), but to play Doom 3 reasonably you\u2019d want a Pentium 4 or Athlon and a Geforce 8400 or Radeon 9550.\n\nSo for me, back around the 2004 holiday season, my feelings about the upcoming Doom 3 were conflated with those of my first large hardware upgrades, which at the time was a very enjoyable experience. I recall purchasing a very fast Sempron processor and a Radeon 9800 graphics card, perhaps the most expensive graphics card I have ever purchased at ~350$ at the time.\n\n[![2013-09-29_00021](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00021-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00021.jpg)\n\nFast forward to 2013, and you have a very different landscape. It\u2019s been 8 years, another degree, many jobs and many games have been left behind. Oddly enough, I\u2019m still gaming on a CPU that was released back in 2005. I spend a great deal less on my gaming hardware than I did back then, in fact much of it comes from thrift stores. My 1600\u00d7900 resolution monitor was 10$ at the Value Village near my house. I re-purposed my wife\u2019s old slim pc (circa 2006) as my gaming and review rig earlier this year when she upgraded to a new i7 laptop. I threw that tiny motherboard in a nice big gaming case and never worry about overheating. I paid 30$ for that case after rebate. I paid 130$ for my gaming review card, a Radeon 7850. I paid 35$ after rebate for my 750 watt \u201cgaming\u201d power supply. Even on an 8-year old CPU most games still scream on high settings. CPU speed means almost nothing for anything but emulation nowadays. Even high definition movies and web browsing are GPU accelerated now.\n\n[![2013-09-25 16.16.54](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-25-16.16.54-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-25-16.16.54.jpg)\n\nWhat does this mean for the original Doom 3 then, at the end of 2013? For one it means I can play through the game in 8-hour play sessions without worrying about my gpu melting. Not sure if this would be the case with the \u201cnew\u201d Doom 3. You see, Doom 3 was released back before all of the big companies released updates via DLC. So Doom 3 saw one expansion pack upon it\u2019s original release, and then nothing for 7 years until earlier this year we got a graphical update and gameplay re-balance in the form of the \u201cDoom 3 BFG Edition\u201d release. While that game is on my list of games to review (and I do own it), I\u2019ll be reviewing the original Doom 3 as it was released in 2005. That means no flashlight mod.\n\n[![2013-09-29_00059](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00059-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00059.jpg)\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t play the original Doom 3, the flashlight mod is the ever-controversial game mod that allows you to use both your flashlight and your gun at the same time. Doom 3 did not allow this upon it\u2019s release. It made for a very tense, difficult game that was at times quite frustrating.\n\n[![2013-09-29_00039](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00039-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00039.jpg)\n\nIt was also very dark and atmospheric, with colored lighting effects everywhere. Critics claimed the lack of a flashlight served more to force the player to experience the new game engine and these lighting effects, rather than the game itself. I\u2019m not convinced that\u2019s the case, but I\u2019ll leave that discussion for later.\n\n[![2013-09-29_00078](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00078-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00078.jpg)\n\nThis game still has the capacity to creep me out. Whether it be bloody half-mutilated bodies nailed to the ceiling, demon spawn which appear from the blood-soaked shadows, or just the soft whispers of \u2018help me\u2019 or \u2018oh god\u2019 which seem to pervade the experience. 8 years later, Doom 3 still has the power to unsettle.\n\n[![2013-09-29_00076](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00076-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00076.jpg)\n\nIt\u2019s a full retelling of the original Doom story, and serves to put the simplistic storyline of the original (Marine on Mars kills demons) into a full on horror setting with the demonic aspect cranked up to 11.\n\n[![2013-09-29_00070](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00070-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00070.jpg)\n\nLots of little details help add to the overall ambiance. Character emails, voice records, video data files and the like are scattered throughout the levels, and provide clues and weapon lockers codes. This keeps the user engaged in the storyline, while simultaneously rewarding the player for seeking out this additional content.\n\n[![2013-09-29_00018](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00018-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00018.jpg)\n\nThe graphics remain as gory and satanic as ever. Enemies explode and disintegrate into a bloody pink mist of hellfire. You\u2019re constantly hearing whispers and dark incantations. This is not the game to play late at night home alone, as it may freak you out. Enemies jump out at you. The decaying space station you are on slowly falls apart around you, hellspawn crawling out of every hole.\n\n[![2013-09-29_00012](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00012-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00012.jpg)\n\nEverything you loved about Doom has made a return and has been augmented in some way. Keycards now are stored on PDA tablets (iPADs a few years early.) All of your favorite enemies from the first games have been visually and physically upgraded and are just as mean as ever. These upgrades serve both as fan-service and as a boost up in the difficulty of each enemy. As such, the amount of enemies you are fighting at any one time has decreased somewhat from the original games. While you may encounter a dozen or so enemies at one time, it\u2019s quite rare that you\u2019ll fight anything close to the legions of enemies the first game threw at you. Doom 3 makes up for this by amplifying both the difficulty and the creepiness factor of each enemy significantly.\n\n[![2013-09-29_00056](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00056-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00056.jpg)\n\nA good example: in the first game, you just see these floating, flaming skulls coming at you. In Doom 3, it\u2019s a fully flushed out story item, and it\u2019s creepy as hell. Shortly after receiving the plasma gun you break into a security room where a woman is crying for your help. Then next thing you know, her head is combusting and her spinal column is removing itself from her body. Watching a person screaming for help before their head catches on fire and detaches from their body is very, very creepy.\n\n[![2013-09-29_00002](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00002-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00002.jpg)\n\nThe creepiness is just a feather in the cap of an overall quite excellent game. From the amplified and dark storyline to the updated graphics and interesting enemies, Doom 3 is still an excellent horror-action FPS that holds up to the standards of 2013. While the graphics are no longer jaw-dropping, 8 years later they remain an impressive and visually engrossing experience and vital gameplay item. Considering its bargain-basement price (and inclusion in many bundles) I highly recommend playing through Doom 3. I rate it an 88%, excellent.\n\n[![2013-09-29_00062](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00062-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00062.jpg)\n\nI\u2019m also including Resurrection of Evil in this review, because it\u2019s really just a short level pack addition to Doom 3 with one great boss battle at the end. It also is generally only sold bundled with the original Doom 3, and in my opinion should be considered part of the original release. There\u2019s not much to say about D3ROE other than it does have a great boss battle at the end, and it\u2019s worth playing through even after you beat Doom 3 just for said battle. Given it\u2019s short length and lack of significant upgrades (or character development), I\u2019d have to give D3ROE a slighter lower score of 83%, just shy of it\u2019s big brother\u2019s score.\n\n[![specs](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>The year was 2005, and it was spring.

The decaying space station you are on slowly falls apart around you, hellspawn crawling out of every hole.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00012.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00012-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"2013-09-29_00012\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4709\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00012-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00012-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00012.jpg 1152w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Everything you loved about Doom has made a return and has been augmented in some way.  Keycards now are stored on PDA tablets (iPADs a few years early.)  All of your favorite enemies from the first games have been visually and physically upgraded and are just as mean as ever.  These upgrades serve both as fan-service and as a boost up in the difficulty of each enemy.  As such, the amount of enemies you are fighting at any one time has decreased somewhat from the original games.   While you may encounter a dozen or so enemies at one time, it&#8217;s quite rare that you&#8217;ll fight anything close to the legions of enemies the first game threw at you.  Doom 3 makes up for this by amplifying both the difficulty and the creepiness factor of each enemy significantly.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00056.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00056-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"2013-09-29_00056\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4708\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00056-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00056-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00056.jpg 1152w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A good example: in the first game, you just see these floating, flaming skulls coming at you.  In Doom 3, it&#8217;s a fully flushed out story item, and it&#8217;s creepy as hell.  Shortly after receiving the plasma gun you break into a security room where a woman is crying for your help.  Then next thing you know, her head is combusting and her spinal column is removing itself from her body.  Watching a person screaming for help before their head catches on fire and detaches from their body is very, very creepy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00002.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00002-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"2013-09-29_00002\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4696\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00002-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00002.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The creepiness is just a feather in the cap of an overall quite excellent game.  From the amplified and dark storyline to the updated graphics and interesting enemies, Doom 3 is still an excellent horror-action FPS that holds up to the standards of 2013.  While the graphics are no longer jaw-dropping, 8 years later they remain an impressive and visually engrossing experience and vital gameplay item.  Considering its bargain-basement price (and inclusion in many bundles) I highly recommend playing through Doom 3.  I rate it an 88%, excellent.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00062.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00062-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"2013-09-29_00062\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4710\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00062-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00062-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00062.jpg 1152w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also including Resurrection of Evil in this review, because it&#8217;s really just a short level pack addition to Doom 3 with one great boss battle at the end.  It also is generally only sold bundled with the original Doom 3, and in my opinion should be considered part of the original release. There&#8217;s not much to say about D3ROE other than it does have a great boss battle at the end, and it&#8217;s worth playing through even after you beat Doom 3 just for said battle.  Given it&#8217;s short length and lack of significant upgrades (or character development), I&#8217;d have to give D3ROE a slighter lower score of 83%, just shy of it&#8217;s big brother&#8217;s score.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs.png\" alt=\"specs\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4654\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs.png 250w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs-150x150.png 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs-50x50.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-29_00021.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 19:27:12 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 19:27:12 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 19:27:12 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4713,"title":"Review: Pitfall + Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure (Genesis)","slug":"review-pitfall-pitafall-the-mayan-adventure-genesis","markdown":"\nI did not have an Atari when I was young. My first console was the NES, so I have never played Pitfall on a console. I did play it on my friends commodore 64, a machine which holds a very special place in my heart as the first machine I ever typed a computer program into, way back in the late 1980s.\n\n[![title1](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title11-300x238.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title11.png)\n\nNevertheless, I\u2019ll be reviewing the Atari version, as I believe in only reviewing games which I own a licence or physical copy of. I also found the Genesis version of Pitfall: The Mayan adventure, so I\u2019ll be reviewing both in a 1-2 review. I don\u2019t currently have a licence to Pitfall 2 for the Atari, but I\u2019m looking the best deals.\n\n**Pitfall (Atari)**\n\n[![aligatordeath](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/aligatordeath-300x208.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/aligatordeath.png)\n\nNo title screens. No bosses. No save games. Fiendish difficulty. Minimal graphics, minimal sound. What\u2019s to like about the original Pitfall for Atari?\n\n[![hiddenlake](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/hiddenlake-300x208.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/hiddenlake.png)\n\nA lot actually. There\u2019s a feeling of adventure. A feeling of make or break adventuring. There\u2019s a brief \u2018do da doo\u2019 noise every time you ride on a rope that I assume was meant to sound similar to Indiana Jones. All-too rare rings give you an extra life. You\u2019re just out there, exploring the jungle as hidden lakes and quicksand appear out of nowhere and threaten to drag you under.\n\n[![holesfromnowhere](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/holesfromnowhere-300x208.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/holesfromnowhere.png)\n\nYou\u2019re constantly assaulted by snakes, invisible lakes, quicksand, scorpions, and time itself. You get 20 minutes total to beat this game, but I\u2019ve never made it past the fifteen minute mark during real gameplay.\n\n[![pit1](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/pit1-300x208.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/pit1.png)\n\nIt\u2019s tough, minimalistic, and an absolute classic. Most if not all modern platformers owe all they have to Pitfall. Though it may not be worth a dollar in modern gaming terms, it likely won\u2019t cost you more than 15c in one of those \u201c80 Atari games for 5$\u201d collections. Well worth your time at 15c, I\u2019d rate it a 67% by modern gaming standards. Fiendishly difficult but rewarding in a minimal sort of way.\n\n**Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure**\n\n[![title2](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title21-300x238.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title21.png)\n\n> Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure is a 16-bit era update to the original Pitfall\u2026 but is it in name only?\n\nNo. While much has changed, there\u2019s much that\u2019s the same. While you traverse the landscape through larger level areas, you still are basically just searching the jungle left and right. You can use a slingshot and various weapons to kill snakes now, but hidden water traps still threaten to drag you to a watery grave at any moment.\n\n[![ilovegold](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/ilovegold-300x248.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/ilovegold.png)\n\nThe timer is gone, which is good. Everything has been updated. The graphics look good, even for a 16-bit era game. They still hold up well 20 years later. They\u2019re a little cartoony, a little gritty, not too pixelated. Everything you want from a retro side-scroller.\n\nThe sound effects are pretty standard, but nothing to complain about. The music is a surprisingly good collection of jungle-themed chiptunes.\n\n[![newhidden](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/newhidden-300x238.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/newhidden.png)\n\nThere are some fun little easter eggs too. Like many games of the era, you\u2019ll get a fun little animation if you stop moving for too long.\n\n[![meditation](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/meditation-300x251.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/meditation.png)\n\nThere is a lot that\u2019s changed since the first Pitfall. There\u2019s more opportunity for backtracking, as the difficulty level has been cranked down quite a bit. It\u2019s still a difficult game, but it\u2019s not legendarily difficult like its predecessor.\n\n[![vines](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/vines-300x256.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/vines.png)\n\nIt\u2019s also a bit of a weird game. You\u2019re throw straight into the typical side-scrolling tropes quite quickly. The sand traps. The bouncing spider webs. The spider monkeys that throw .. something at you. You find hearts (real human hearts) floating in the sky as power ups. You hang from what look like giant bouncing uvulas (I reaaaaly hope they are uvulas!)\n\n[![tongue](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/tongue-300x259.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/tongue.png)\n\nThere are levels now, discrete blocks of gameplay that separate out. There are also level bosses. Wild animals that require many hits and some agile maneuvers. The difficulty level is still very, very high. You start out with 3 lives and three continues, and you\u2019ll need each one.\n\n[![continues](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/continues-300x255.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/continues.png)\n\nYou\u2019ll still need to be able to jump gators and swing on vines, but you\u2019ll also need a great deal more varied platforming skills to make it to the final level.\n\n[![moregators](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/moregators-300x256.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/moregators.png)\n\nThen again, you can always use the level select cheat. Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure came out at a time when cheats weren\u2019t part of DLC or cost a fee. They were included as a way to add additional gameplay, as well as an easy debug option for testers. In any case, you\u2019ll at minimum want to use one of the \u2018increased lives\u2019 cheats to get you through, and the level select code to experience the mine-cart level.\n\n[![minecar](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/minecar-300x259.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/minecar.png)\n\nBest of all, there\u2019s a code to play the complete original Pitfall game on your Genesis. That\u2019s like getting a pretty decent Atario game with your shitty Genesis game, bonus!\n\n[![retro](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/retro-300x254.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/retro.png)\n\nWhile there is a fair bit of gameplay, the difficulty level is set squarely in the \u2018retro hard\u2019 category. The inclusion of level select and extra lives codes alleviate this a bit, but do nothing to make the core gameplay truly fun. It\u2019s a generic 16-bit platformer dressed up in Pitfall clothes. All that\u2019s difficult isn\u2019t classic, or memorable.\n\n[![mayan1](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/mayan1-300x238.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/mayan1.png)\n\nIs Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure worth your time? Well that depends. You can likely pick up the cartridge for 3$ on eBay. It\u2019s probably worth the 3$ if you\u2019re into retro platformers or a fan of Pitfall. There\u2019s a fair bit of fun and a smidge of varied gameplay to be had, even if it is a bit bland. Sadly, the best part may be the inclusion of the original Pitfall as an unlockable cheat. I\u2019d rate Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure a 65% by modern standards. A middling platformer that\u2019s not particularly worth remembering.\n\n\n","html":"<p>I did not have an Atari when I was young.

You&#8217;re just out there, exploring the jungle as hidden lakes and quicksand appear out of nowhere and threaten to drag you under.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/holesfromnowhere.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/holesfromnowhere-300x208.png\" alt=\"holesfromnowhere\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4718\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/holesfromnowhere-300x208.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/holesfromnowhere.png 646w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re constantly assaulted by snakes, invisible lakes, quicksand, scorpions, and time itself.

Most if not all modern platformers owe all they have to Pitfall.  Though it may not be worth a dollar in modern gaming terms, it likely won&#8217;t cost you more than 15c in one of those &#8220;80 Atari games for 5$&#8221; collections.  Well worth your time at 15c, I&#8217;d rate it a 67% by modern gaming standards.  Fiendishly difficult but rewarding in a minimal sort of way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title21.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title21-300x238.png\" alt=\"title2\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4721\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title21-300x238.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title21.png 966w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure is a 16-bit era update to the original Pitfall&#8230; but is it in name only?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>No.  While much has changed, there&#8217;s much that&#8217;s the same.  While you traverse the landscape through larger level areas, you still are basically just searching the jungle left and right.

Everything has been updated.  The graphics look good, even for a 16-bit era game.  They still hold up well 20 years later.  They&#8217;re a little cartoony, a little gritty, not too pixelated.  Everything you want from a retro side-scroller.<\/p>\n<p>The sound effects are pretty standard, but nothing to complain about.  The music is a surprisingly good collection of jungle-themed chiptunes.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/newhidden.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/newhidden-300x238.png\" alt=\"newhidden\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4728\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/newhidden-300x238.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/newhidden.png 966w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There are some fun little easter eggs too.

There&#8217;s more opportunity for backtracking, as the difficulty level has been cranked down quite a bit.

You&#8217;re throw straight into the typical side-scrolling tropes quite quickly.  The sand traps.  The bouncing spider webs.  The spider monkeys that throw .. something at you.  You find hearts (real human hearts) floating in the sky as power ups.

Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure came out at a time when cheats weren&#8217;t part of DLC or cost a fee.  They were included as a way to add additional gameplay, as well as an easy debug option for testers.  In any case, you&#8217;ll at minimum want to use one of the &#8216;increased lives&#8217; cheats to get you through, and the level select code to experience the mine-cart level.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/minecar.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/minecar-300x259.png\" alt=\"minecar\" width=\"300\" height=\"259\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4730\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/minecar-300x259.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/minecar.png 966w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Best of all, there&#8217;s a code to play the complete original Pitfall game on your Genesis.

The inclusion of level select and extra lives codes alleviate this a bit, but do nothing to make the core gameplay truly fun.  It&#8217;s a generic 16-bit platformer dressed up in Pitfall clothes.

Well that depends.  You can likely pick up the cartridge for 3$ on eBay.  It&#8217;s probably worth the 3$ if you&#8217;re into retro platformers or a fan of Pitfall.  There&#8217;s a fair bit of fun and a smidge of varied gameplay to be had, even if it is a bit bland.  Sadly, the best part may be the inclusion of the original Pitfall as an unlockable cheat.  I&#8217;d rate Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure a 65% by modern standards.  A middling platformer that&#8217;s not particularly worth remembering.<\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/title11.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 02:51:02 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 02:53:01 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 02:51:02 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4740,"title":"Tutorial: Crashlytics + Android Studio = Crash Reporting on Easy Mode","slug":"tutorial-crashlytics-android-studio-crash-reporting-on-easy-mode","markdown":"\nCrashlytics is a slick and remarkably easy automatic crash reporting service that integrates tightly with your existing IDE.

Copy the crashlytics jar to your projects\u2019 libs dir and add it to your app\u2019s classpath. (may not be needed for those who have moved to Gradle)\n\nThat\u2019s that.

You don\u2019t need to log into a website to check your crashes, or ever think about app ids or worry if you updated your manifest. You\u2019ll receive an email directly that you added a new app, and you can always log into the web app directly for crash reports if you prefer.

While punishingly difficult and sadly a bit too short, there\u2019s a lot of variety to be had in the way you play through the levels. Your sword and throwing stars will be upgraded automatically as you move to the later levels, so if you wish you jump through the trees at high speeds and go straight to the boss with no magic, you can. You can also fight the never-ending horde of ninjas who fly at you from all angles below the treetops, on the ground, and in the ninja-infested caves below the forest.

Demon sword is a difficult, frustrating game. It stands as a testament to the overall difficulty level of most games of the era. It allows you to go so far, then crushes you and sends you back to a re-spawn point. Those 3 lives are precious few, and the sword you fight with for the first 2 levels is a butter knife of gaming legend.\n\nThis is also a game that rewards your ability to memorize a series of moves and execute them flawlessly.

This game makes the original Mario Brothers seem like an epic adventure (not that it wasn\u2019t, but I\u2019ll get to that another review.)\n\nIn the end, the game is too short to be called a true classic. It\u2019s fun, and the box art features Arnold, and you\u2019ll get your couple buck\u2019s worth. Just don\u2019t expect to remember the nuance or feeling of adventure 20 years later.

Just this latest release I implemented three different sets of video APIs and an audio equalizer. That\u2019s the one I\u2019m most excited about, my new audio equalizer that comes with our Android client. It\u2019s something that our users have been asking for forever, and it touches on some of my favorite areas of expertise.\n\nI\u2019ve written many times before about the various audio engines I\u2019ve written in the past. Some are locked away in the IP of huge corporations\/universities\/governments, some are open source on my GitHub page, some are lost to the winds of time. That doesn\u2019t concern me as much as you might think. Like our own DNA, the underlying code for most major audio engines is 99% the same across all vendors. Those little differences almost always comes down to a combination of hardware specific functionality, and hardware specific workarounds.\n\nOur EQ is no different. I spent quite a bit of time patching, bugfixing and re-factoring initialization routines and audio event handlers to ensure a consistent, excellent experience across Android devices. And now that it\u2019s out, I find myself adjusting levels and showing it off to whoever I meet. My RK3066 Android-TV stick is finally getting some much needed love. I finally have a decent equalizer that I can use in my car. It\u2019s absolutely a 100% better experience, and it\u2019s been pushing my own daily listening hours up ever higher.\n\n[![2013-10-27-10-59-46](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/2013-10-27-10-59-46-168x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/2013-10-27-10-59-46.png)\n\nAnd how do our users find the results of my (and our most excellent test team\u2019s) effort? I\u2019ll let the bevy of 5-star reviews that have started to pour in speak for themselves.\n\n[Try it for yourself](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.rhapsody), if you\u2019re so inclined, and let me know what you think.

I&#8217;ve been tweaking the new audio equalizer I wrote that comes with Rhapsody for Android.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/2013-10-27-10-59-20.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/2013-10-27-10-59-20-168x300.png\" alt=\"2013-10-27-10-59-20\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4815\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/2013-10-27-10-59-20-168x300.png 168w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/2013-10-27-10-59-20-576x1024.png 576w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/2013-10-27-10-59-20.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Working for a large service-based company like Rhapsody, I get to write a lot of cool features that go out to a million+ people.  Just this latest release I implemented three different sets of video APIs and an audio equalizer. That&#8217;s the one I&#8217;m most excited about, my new audio equalizer that comes with our Android client.  It&#8217;s something that our users have been asking for forever, and it touches on some of my favorite areas of expertise.  <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written many times before about the various audio engines I&#8217;ve written in the past.  Some are locked away in the IP of huge corporations\/universities\/governments, some are open source on my GitHub page, some are lost to the winds of time.  That doesn&#8217;t concern me as much as you might think.  Like our own DNA, the underlying code for most major audio engines is 99% the same across all vendors.  Those little differences almost always comes down to a combination of hardware specific functionality, and hardware specific workarounds.  <\/p>\n<p>Our EQ is no different.  I spent quite a bit of time patching, bugfixing and re-factoring initialization routines and audio event handlers to ensure a consistent, excellent experience across Android devices.  And now that it&#8217;s out, I find myself adjusting levels and showing it off to whoever I meet.  My RK3066 Android-TV stick is finally getting some much needed love.  I finally have a decent equalizer that I can use in my car.  It&#8217;s absolutely a 100% better experience, and it&#8217;s been pushing my own daily listening hours up ever higher.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/2013-10-27-10-59-46.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/2013-10-27-10-59-46-168x300.png\" alt=\"2013-10-27-10-59-46\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4816\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/2013-10-27-10-59-46-168x300.png 168w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/2013-10-27-10-59-46-576x1024.png 576w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/2013-10-27-10-59-46.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And how do our users find the results of my (and our most excellent test team&#8217;s) effort?

Not quite. There\u2019s a few key differentiators. The game is clearly segmented into three distinct chapters, each one corresponding to one of the rival gangs of the city.

Good times.<\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-01-12.12.45.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 01 Dec 2013 20:28:44 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 01 Dec 2013 20:28:44 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 01 Dec 2013 20:28:44 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":4863,"title":"Review: Skullgirls","slug":"review-skullgirls","markdown":"\nSkullgirls is a gorgeous, highly polished fighter.

Fans of the KoF series and anyone who has played a fighting game in the past 25 years knows exactly what to expect. Arcade, story, and versus modes, with a helping of collectable artwork thrown in for the die-hards.\n\n[![2013-12-07_00038](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00038-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00038.jpg)\n\nThe artwork is gorgeous, but retro. While the backgrounds really pop and are extremely detailed, some of the character models look a little pixelated at 1080p resolution. You get to choose your character color during character selection as well. The backgrounds are balanced and intricate without seeming too busy.\n\n[![2013-12-07_00017](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00017-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00017.jpg)\n\nThe interface is crisp and modern. Below your health bar you constantly receive mini quests for extra super meter (punch three times! Use a super!). I\u2019m not sure if the intended effect is to make you a more varied player or just to spice up the gameplay. It works on both accounts, but can make the screen seem a bit too cluttered.\n\n[![2013-12-07_00001](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00001-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00001.jpg)\n\nAt the beginning of each fight, the characters you select have a little parlay with their opponents. This text is customized based on the backstories of each characters, and the interplay is a fun way to add additional storyline. This is a chance for comic relief and luckily the writers of KofXIII use it to great effect.\n\n[![2013-12-07_00003](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00003-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00003.jpg)\n\nSpeaking of storyline, KoFXIII goes back to the well and brings back the Iori storyline. The Fatal Fury characters especially are their younger counterparts (not yet Mark of the Wolves age) and it feels like KoFXIII is seeking to reboot the storyline a bit.\n\n[![2013-12-07_00027](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00027-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00027.jpg)\n\nThe gameplay is fast and furious, classic King of Fighters. Fans of 2D fighters will be pleasantly satisfied with the precise timing, fast pace, and combo\/counter system.\n\n[![2013-12-07_00035](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00035-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00035.jpg)\n\nIn fact, it feels like this entire gaming experience has been tailor made for fans of the genre. Even moreso than the PS3\/X360 releases of 2012, this release feels like something every fan should have in their collection. From better online play to updated graphics this is the best King of Fighters experience I\u2019ve had on the PC (usually emulation.) Even the gallery mode feels more at home.\n\n[![2013-12-07_00040](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00040-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00040.jpg)\n\nAt the end of the day, there\u2019s not much else you could want in a King of Fighters game on Steam. This is an excellent port which shines on the PC and further helps to usher in the new age of PC gaming. I rate it a very respectable 90\/100.\n\n[![specs](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/specs.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00019.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00019-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-12-07_00019\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4875\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00019-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00019-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>King of Fighters XIII is a true heir to the golden age of Neo Geo fighters.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00031.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00031-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-12-07_00031\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4876\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00031-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-07_00031-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This is a full-on port of King of Fighters XIII, with all of the features you&#8217;d expect from a AAA fighting title.

I doubt the system is being taxed much. Frankly it doesn\u2019t matter for this sort of title. The graphics are cute, appropriate, and enjoyable. There are plenty of little flourishes and 3-d sparkle in the backgrounds to give the game an engrossing atmosphere. As this is part of the \u201cYear of Luigi\u201d initiative, there\u2019s 8-bit Luigi stickers hidden throughout boss levels in the game. This adds yet another level of \u201cmeta-collecting.\u201d It definitely brings a smile to your face when you see a classic Luigi sprite plastered up on a hidden cave wall underneath a Koopa-kid\u2019s castle.\n\n[![art3](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/art3-300x202.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/art3.png)\n\nThe addition of \u201cHold LZ for Nabbit\u201d functionality is a welcome breath of easy in a hot desert of gaming challenge. When you enter any level, you can hold the LZ button to play through that level as Nabbit, a rabbit-thief like character who is invincible to enemy attacks. You\u2019ll still die if you fall off the side of a cliff or get squashed (so it\u2019s still somewhat challenging), but enemies and enemy attacks pass right through you. For those trying to make it past one of NSLU\u2019s super-challenging levels, it can be the difference between frustration and enjoyment.\n\nI actually used the Wii-U pad for playing much of NSLU while my television was occupied with a Netflix movie or Blu-ray. The graphics lend themselves well to the lower-resolution screen of the Wii-U pad and I finally see the appeal of the \u201ceither-screen\u201d setup of the Wii-U. It\u2019s not just for taking on road-trips or to the airport. It really does work in a living-room situation as well.\n\n[![buy-now-pack-shot](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/buy-now-pack-shot.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/buy-now-pack-shot.jpg)\n\nI played through about half of NSLU with a friend and the multi-player aspect is fantastic. Up to four players can play through the story portion of the game (as with all NSMB titles) and you\u2019ll find youself dusting off those wii-motes for the first time in ages. Heck, I hadn\u2019t turned on my Wii-U in a while before NSLU came on sale for 15$ at the big-box store near my house. And I\u2019m quite glad I picked it up too. You see, Mario games tend not to dip in price. The original NSMB for Wii (almost 5 years old now) is still retailing at 50$. That\u2019s pretty steep for a 4-year old game on a last-generation system. That\u2019s Nintendo for you. So, to get a disk with an entire Luigi-centric skinning of NSMB-U for less than 20$ is a heck of a deal for gamers on a budget.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, this is classic Super Mario fare. There\u2019s plenty of power-ups, enemies, and fun boss fights as usual. The game feels like a mash-up between Super Mario World, Mario 3, and New Super Mario (Wii). That\u2019s a very, very good mix of gaming ingredients.\n\nIn the end, NSLU is a great addition to the Mario canon and a great value. Not just an add-on, NSLU stands on its own gaming legs as a challenging entry into the Wii-U software library. As it can be purchased used for around 20$, it represents a terrific value as well. I rate NSLU a 90\/100. Terrific, challenging, fun.\n\nNote, as with all Nintendo Wii and Wii-U purchases, I highly recommend you purchase the physical disk version. Downloadable versions are tied to your specific console, so if your console dies that\u2019s it. No more games. For that reason alone I only buy disk versions for Wii-U.\n\n\n","html":"<p>New Super Luigi U (NSLU) is one of the best deals currently available for the fledgling Wii U System.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/art-multiplay.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/art-multiplay-300x152.png\" alt=\"art-multiplay\" width=\"300\" height=\"152\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4905\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/art-multiplay-300x152.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/art-multiplay.png 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The graphics are crisp and suburb, just like New Super Mario.  I doubt the system is being taxed much.  Frankly it doesn&#8217;t matter for this sort of title.  The graphics are cute, appropriate, and enjoyable. There are plenty of little flourishes and 3-d sparkle in the backgrounds to give the game an engrossing atmosphere.  As this is part of the &#8220;Year of Luigi&#8221; initiative, there&#8217;s 8-bit Luigi stickers hidden throughout boss levels in the game.  This adds yet another level of &#8220;meta-collecting.&#8221;  It definitely brings a smile to your face when you see a classic Luigi sprite plastered up on a hidden cave wall underneath a Koopa-kid&#8217;s castle.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/art3.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/art3-300x202.png\" alt=\"art3\" width=\"300\" height=\"202\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4907\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/art3-300x202.png 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/art3.png 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The addition of &#8220;Hold LZ for Nabbit&#8221; functionality is a welcome breath of easy in a hot desert of gaming challenge.  When you enter any level, you can hold the LZ button to play through that level as Nabbit, a rabbit-thief like character who is invincible to enemy attacks.  You&#8217;ll still die if you fall off the side of a cliff or get squashed (so it&#8217;s still somewhat challenging), but enemies and enemy attacks pass right through you.  For those trying to make it past one of NSLU&#8217;s super-challenging levels, it can be the difference between frustration and enjoyment.<\/p>\n<p>I actually used the Wii-U pad for playing much of NSLU while my television was occupied with a Netflix movie or Blu-ray.  The graphics lend themselves well to the lower-resolution screen of the Wii-U pad and I finally see the appeal of the &#8220;either-screen&#8221; setup of the Wii-U.  It&#8217;s not just for taking on road-trips or to the airport.  It really does work in a living-room situation as well.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/buy-now-pack-shot.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/buy-now-pack-shot.jpg\" alt=\"buy-now-pack-shot\" width=\"124\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4908\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I played through about half of NSLU with a friend and the multi-player aspect is fantastic.  Up to four players can play through the story portion of the game (as with all NSMB titles) and you&#8217;ll find youself dusting off those wii-motes for the first time in ages.  Heck, I hadn&#8217;t turned on my Wii-U in a while before NSLU came on sale for 15$ at the big-box store near my house.  And I&#8217;m quite glad I picked it up too.  You see, Mario games tend not to dip in price.  The original NSMB for Wii (almost 5 years old now) is still retailing at 50$.  That&#8217;s pretty steep for a 4-year old game on a last-generation system.  That&#8217;s Nintendo for you.  So, to get a disk with an entire Luigi-centric skinning of NSMB-U for less than 20$ is a heck of a deal for gamers on a budget. <\/p>\n<p>As for the gameplay itself, this is classic Super Mario fare.  There&#8217;s plenty of power-ups, enemies, and fun boss fights as usual.  The game feels like a mash-up between Super Mario World, Mario 3, and New Super Mario (Wii).  That&#8217;s a very, very good mix of gaming ingredients.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, NSLU is a great addition to the Mario canon and a great value.  Not just an add-on, NSLU stands on its own gaming legs as a challenging entry into the Wii-U software library.  As it can be purchased used for around 20$, it represents a terrific value as well.  I rate NSLU a 90\/100.  Terrific, challenging, fun.   <\/p>\n<p>Note, as with all Nintendo Wii and Wii-U purchases, I highly recommend you purchase the physical disk version.  Downloadable versions are tied to your specific console, so if your console dies that&#8217;s it.  No more games.

God of War came out a decade ago, and as with every decade-old pillar of gaming the mechanics will be copied and folded into different configurations for years to come.\n\n[![2013-12-28_00020](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-28_00020-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-28_00020.jpg)\n\nAs Mario helped to usher in an era of 2d platformers in the mid-eighties and early nineties so did Kratos help to usher in the era of giant bosses and flaming magical whips and angel wing double-jumps and climbing up titans\u2026 Ok, it does sound a bit specific now doesn\u2019t it? Still, Lords of Shadow takes freely the familiar gameplay of God of War that we might be immersed in a fantastic storyline without worrying about learning the gameplay mechanics.\n\n[![2013-12-28_00026](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-28_00026-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-28_00026.jpg)\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, and moody. Every scene is like a painting come to life. The game is worth playing through on easy mode just for taking in the masterful atmosphere in a relaxing way. This is a game made by and for people who love the characters and aesthetic of Castlevania.\n\n[![2013-12-28_00017](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-28_00017-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-28_00017.jpg)\n\nMake no mistake about it, I am one of the aforementioned Castlevania lovers. I\u2019ve played every single one, from the halcyon NES days through Symphony of the Night and the glorious GBA\/DS golden years it spawned up to today. I was originally hoping for gameplay a little closer to Symphony of the Night (or the Dawn series, wouldn\u2019t that be wild! Summoning all those creatures in a big 3d castle you\u2019re exploring! Game idea!) At any rate, the game that I got exceeded my expectations in many ways.\n\n[![2013-12-28_00015](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-28_00015-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-28_00015.jpg)\n\nI honestly would have skipped this title completely if I hadn\u2019t pushed through and played the second level. The first level sets this game up as a full on God of War clone. It doesn\u2019t showcase any of the clever twists in gameplay that begin to add layer after layer of strategy.

He narrates the majority of the game from the loading screens between levels, and has a significant part to play in the story as well. This is a welcome theme in the game, characters being somewhat well rounded. Even the bosses themselves have back-stories and internal motivations besides the ole \u201ckill the player!\u201d.\n\nThe controls are tight, if a bit overly complex. For some reason it feels a bit slower that God of War. If anything, I\u2019d say that Lords of Shadow took a page out of Dark Souls playbook. Some of the boss battles feel like they could have been ripped from Dark Souls as well. This is a good, if challenging, addition to the game.\n\n[![2013-12-29_00007](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-29_00007-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-29_00007.jpg)\n\nThe difficulty of the puzzles (and puzzle-bosses) is fair to moderate. There are certainly some \u201ctable-flipping\u201d moments, especially towards the end of the game. Even experienced gamers may find themselves frustrated by some of the later level design. It\u2019s mostly a good frustration though, and the artwork is so gorgeous and intricate throughout you\u2019ll hardly mind the challenge.\n\n[![2013-12-29_00006](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-29_00006-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-29_00006.jpg)\n\nThe inclusion of the two expansions is a welcome bit of extra storyline to the Ultimate Edition, and it serves to tie up some loose ends in the plot of the original Lords of Shadow. Unfortunately, the production values are a bit lacking. Rather than fully rendered 3D cut-scenes, you\u2019re treated to semi-animated sketches (the kind that came with toys on VHS tapes back in the 1980s.) These are well drawn and don\u2019t detract from the overall story, but it does feel like a bit of a rush job, especially considering the extremely high production values of the original Lords of Shadow. I\u2019m also pretty sure that half of the level scenes were recycled bits from earlier levels. Still, the boss battle that\u2019s included is a fun and sometimes frustratingly difficult set of levels, and it\u2019s true to the spirit of the original release.\n\n[![2013-12-29_00002](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-29_00002-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-29_00002.jpg)\n\nWith a somewhat complex combo system, medium to hard difficulty curve, and mature subject material, Lords of Shadow certainly isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s for me though. I found myself continually glued to my monitor, eyes affixed on the gorgeous scenes that played out before me. There\u2019s a fair amount of gameplay for this sort of game, perhaps ~20-25 hours if you\u2019re not rushing through things. It\u2019s an enjoyable 20 hours too. You can snag the ultimate edition on Steam\/GoG\/GMG for around ~$15-$20 during the winter sales and I highly recommend doing so. Stick around for a few levels and you won\u2019t be disappointed. I rate Castlevania Lords of Shadow Ultimate edition a rock-star 95\/100. While I was initially hesitant about forking out the premium retail price, I ended up enjoying it immensely and can\u2019t wait for a sequel.\n\n[![review_banner](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/review_banner-200x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/review_banner.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-28_00018.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-28_00018-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"2013-12-28_00018\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4935\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-28_00018-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-28_00018-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Castlevania Lords of Shadow Ultimate Edition is more than just your average God of War clone.

I don\u2019t mean \u201coh wow, this game is so great, this is the best platformer of the year!\u201d. No. I mean \u201cthis game is so excellent, it reminds us what Nintendo means to our culture and gives the Wii U a fighting chance in the console wars.\u201d Seriously. I often found myself stunned how much fun I (and a few of my friends) were having.\n\n[![ss2](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/ss2-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/ss2.jpg)\n\nSuper Mario World for the Super Nintendo (particularly the GBA remake) must be my favorite game of all time, as I\u2019ve found myself going back and completing it (and purchasing it!) again and again. I\u2019ve played it on every Nintendo console and re-release, and emulated it on myriad devices for over 20 years. The graphics, level design, and pure fun to challenge ratio are timeless.\n\n[![Super-Mario-3D-World-28](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Super-Mario-3D-World-28-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Super-Mario-3D-World-28.jpg)\n\nIt\u2019s been 23 years, but I finally recaptured those feelings of pure joy whilst playing a Mario game. Super Mario 3d World is the first Mario game since Super Mario World that truly meets or exceeds the amazingly high bar of quality Super Mario World first raised with the launch of the SNES.\n\n[![super-mario-3d-world-3](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/super-mario-3d-world-3-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/super-mario-3d-world-3.jpg)\n\nAnd SM3DW does exceed Super Mario World in one very important way. Co-op gameplay is really fun. If we had this kind of gameplay back in the day when there was an NES or SNES in their living room the world would be a very different place now. All the nerds (myself included) would have learned to play together. Just think of what we could have accomplished! We could have completely avoided Windows Vista!\n\n[![images](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/images.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/images.jpg)\n\nHonestly, SM3DW should have been a launch game. The Wii U would have sold about 10x more by now if it had been bundled with SM3DW.

It takes a bit of gaming goodness from every Mario game to come before it, and shines. There\u2019s a terrific Mario Kart throwback level that\u2019ll have you laughing and grinning from ear to ear.

Does it manage to surpass it\u2019s predecessor, or does it get bogged down in the over-the-top ridiculousness of the Third Street Saints?\n\n[![2014-02-02_00001](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-02_00001-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-02_00001.jpg)\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, this game was a fun, streamlined experience. It\u2019s clear the designers listened to player feedback from SR2, as many of the tiny annoyances that cropped up in SR2 have been completely eliminated. That means no more instant-ragdoll frustration, more checkpoints, a more streamlined story, and more inter-character dialog.\n\n[![2014-01-29_00010](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-01-29_00010-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-01-29_00010.jpg)\n\nIn terms of making SR3 a fun experience, this game is a rousing success. Right off the bat you\u2019re thrown into a large, vibrant city full of activities and hidden collectibles. There\u2019s a fun recurring hollywood theme (and one of the DLC\u2019s exclusively deals with the hollywood blockbuster angle), as well as an over-the-top wrestling story-arc that\u2019s well executed.\n\n[![2014-02-02_00016](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-02_00016-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-02_00016.jpg)\n\nThe graphics have been kicked up a notch, and my aging gaming system is struggling to keep up. It just barely eeks out a playable 30fps on my current (albeit quite aging) rig.\n\n[![2014-02-01_00010](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-01_00010-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-01_00010.jpg)\n\nThe engine itself seems to have gotten an overhaul as well. Welcome additions include better map management, auto-respawn (for collisions that leave you stuck under a car), and the ability to record a movie of gameplay at any time.\n\n[![2014-01-04_00003](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-01-04_00003-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-01-04_00003.jpg)\n\nAs usual, the game is split up between missions that further the story and side-activities that earn you guns, cash, and property.\n\n[![2014-01-04_00004](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-01-04_00004-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-01-04_00004.jpg)\n\nRespect is still a large factor in the game, but I never found myself unable to play a mission because \u201cyou don\u2019t have enough respect to play this mission.\u201d This was a welcome gameplay balancing. Honestly, if you don\u2019t want to pad the length of a game with mini-games that\u2019s your prerogative. Sometimes you just want to experience a story. SR3 lets you get back to the story at your leisure.\n\n[![2014-02-02_00006](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-02_00006-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-02_00006.jpg)\n\nThe vehicles have gotten a few significant upgrades, not the least of which are rocket-powered flying craft (like my favorite, the \u2018Salem\u2019 flying broomstick). Yes, you can literally take a broomstick up to the heavens and rain down fury from above as you fall down towards earth in a blaze of glory.\n\n[![2014-02-01_00002](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-01_00002-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-01_00002.jpg)\n\nWhile there are still a significant number of minigames, there feels like there are fewer storyline missions than in SR2. I managed to finish SR3 in about a month of casual play (20-30 hours) alongside the absolute avalanche of time that Super Mario 3d World commanded. This is a bit less time than I spent on SR2 or the original Saints Row, and It feels like this is due to having fewer storyline missions.\n\n[![2014-02-01_00001](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-01_00001-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-01_00001.jpg)\n\nAll your old friends are back though, and the supporting cast is as strong as ever. Dr. Genki makes another fun set of appearances, and there are plenty of new homies to be recruited to the cause.\n\n[![2014-01-03_00003](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-01-03_00003-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-01-03_00003.jpg)\n\nWhile the story has taken a slight hit, it\u2019s also been streamlined significantly. No longer is your city divided up into three areas, each representing a gang (and homie) that will occupy your time in that region. Now you simply call up your homies for missions, and advance the story. Some homies will have a focus on a specific rival gang, but you\u2019ll still get plenty of chance to play with your favorite Saints Row homies vs any of the rival gangs.\n\n[![2014-02-02_00026](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-02_00026-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-02_00026.jpg)\n\nThat\u2019s really the main selling point of any of the Saints Row series for me, the continuation of the (quite engaging) storyline that was started in the original Saints Row. You\u2019re always left wondering how crazy things are going to get, whether it\u2019s rolling a giant yarn-ball across traffic or speeding through tanks on a flaming ATV.\n\n[![2014-02-02_00021](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-02_00021-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-02_00021.jpg)\n\nThis also marks the beginning of the superpowered aspect of the Saints Row series. Three has you guzzling tainted Saints Row cola for super-speed, as well has diving into a mini-matrix for cyberspace missions. It\u2019s a precursor to the super-powered cyber madness of SR4, but it doesn\u2019t feel out of place in the world of SR3.\n\n[![2014-02-01_00003](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-01_00003-300x168.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-01_00003.jpg)\n\nIn the end, SR3 is an excellent experience and well worth your time. It can often be purchased for ~7$ on flash-sales (or is included free with the purchase of Saints Row 4 at many locations.)

Do the high production values and deeply emotional plot deliver on the game\u2019s lofty pedigree, or is this a rare low-point in the catalog of Quantic Dream?\n\n[![JodieAiden_08_600x620](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/JodieAiden_08_600x620-290x300.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/JodieAiden_08_600x620.jpg)\n\nRight off the bat you will be impressed with the graphics. Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe both look very, very realistic. The environments are stunning, and the high bar set years ago by Heavy Rain has only been raised with B:TS. There is not a single moment in the game that I didn\u2019t think \u201cthese are some of the best graphics of the past 5 years.\u201d It\u2019s a AAA experience that is wholly centered around emotionality, even in the visual domain. The emotionality of the (very talented) actors come through in the highly detailed facial models. Tears look real. Rain, lighting, atmospheric effects are all deftly used. These graphics are of the highest caliber, and many times you\u2019ll forget you\u2019re playing through a game. You\u2019re IN the narrative, IN the scene. This is the highest praise I can give.\n\n[![GameplayBTS_600x310](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/GameplayBTS_600x310-300x155.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/GameplayBTS_600x310.jpg)\n\nThe gameplay itself is reminiscent of Heavy Rain, with limited heavy-action sequences interspersed with well-timed emotionally gripping narrative. This isn\u2019t a sit-and-watch type narrative though, as you\u2019ll be subtly interacting with the characters on-screen during these narratives in another nod to Heavy Rain. There will be tiny indicators (think less annoying quick-time-event type games) that let you know which direction to push your analog sticks. These are constantly woven into the gameplay and used to great effect. Perhaps these indicators show you how to avoid a punch, or which direction to look. Often they\u2019re used simply to keep you engaged in the experience during an emotional scene.\n\n[![Starring_600x310](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/Starring_600x310-300x155.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/Starring_600x310.jpg)\n\nThere\u2019s quite a large difference between watching your character struggle with an emotional revelation, rocking back and forth vs subtly moving your character\u2019s field of view back and forth to cause them to rock. Both methods can be emotionally powerful, but the latter physically connects the player to that emotion. Your view is swaying, disorienting. You\u2019re a part of the narrative. This is one of the core reasons we game as a culture, these pure moments of escapism and narrative. You find yourself sucked into the world of these characters, and for a time you\u2019re just as caught up in the supernatural goings-on as the characters. This can be terrifying and enlightening, fast-paced and slow-motion all at once. You\u2019re going to like it.\n\n[![image_2_600x310](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/image_2_600x310-300x155.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/image_2_600x310.jpg)\n\nNow here\u2019s the interesting thing. It\u2019s quite often I think that a 3-hour movie wasn\u2019t worth the 12$ ticket price. Whether it be the storyline wasn\u2019t up to snuff or the cinematography was lacking, I can be a fairly picky consumer. B:TS is not a long game by any stretch of the imagination. It reminds me very much of the first Uncharted game in that respect. Shorter than you imagine, but you are left wondering if it seemed so short because the quality of the experience was so high. B:TS is an expensive game. You can pick it up used for ~30$ on eBay, and new copies still run in the 40 to 50 dollar range. How then, can I recommend a game so highly that costs so much for the time that you spend?\n\n[![url_12_600x310](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/url_12_600x310-300x155.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/url_12_600x310.jpg)\n\nIt\u2019s easy actually, Beyond: Two Souls is a great game.

And this script demands they bring their A game. Constant fear, a troubled emotional past, mysterious and dangerous demons and spiritual threats all blend together in an exquisite narrative.

Do the high production values and deeply emotional plot deliver on the game&#8217;s lofty pedigree, or is this a rare low-point in the catalog of Quantic Dream?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/JodieAiden_08_600x620.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/JodieAiden_08_600x620-290x300.jpg\" alt=\"JodieAiden_08_600x620\" width=\"290\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4991\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/JodieAiden_08_600x620-290x300.jpg 290w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/JodieAiden_08_600x620.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Right off the bat you will be impressed with the graphics.  Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe both look very, very realistic.  The environments are stunning, and the high bar set years ago by Heavy Rain has only been raised with B:TS.  There is not a single moment in the game that I didn&#8217;t think &#8220;these are some of the best graphics of the past 5 years.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a AAA experience that is wholly centered around emotionality, even in the visual domain.  The emotionality of the (very talented) actors come through in the highly detailed facial models.  Tears look real.  Rain, lighting, atmospheric effects are all deftly used.  These graphics are of the highest caliber, and many times you&#8217;ll forget you&#8217;re playing through a game.  You&#8217;re IN the narrative, IN the scene.  This is the highest praise I can give.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/GameplayBTS_600x310.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/GameplayBTS_600x310-300x155.jpg\" alt=\"GameplayBTS_600x310\" width=\"300\" height=\"155\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4992\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/GameplayBTS_600x310-300x155.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/GameplayBTS_600x310.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The gameplay itself is reminiscent of Heavy Rain, with limited heavy-action sequences interspersed with well-timed emotionally gripping narrative.  This isn&#8217;t a sit-and-watch type narrative though, as you&#8217;ll be subtly interacting with the characters on-screen during these narratives in another nod to Heavy Rain.  There will be tiny indicators (think less annoying quick-time-event type games) that let you know which direction to push your analog sticks.  These are constantly woven into the gameplay and used to great effect.  Perhaps these indicators show you how to avoid a punch, or which direction to look.  Often they&#8217;re used simply to keep you engaged in the experience during an emotional scene.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/Starring_600x310.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/Starring_600x310-300x155.jpg\" alt=\"Starring_600x310\" width=\"300\" height=\"155\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4993\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/Starring_600x310-300x155.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/Starring_600x310.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s quite a large difference between watching your character struggle with an emotional revelation, rocking back and forth vs subtly moving your character&#8217;s field of view back and forth to cause them to rock.  Both methods can be emotionally powerful, but the latter physically connects the player to that emotion.  Your view is swaying, disorienting.  You&#8217;re a part of the narrative.  This is one of the core reasons we game as a culture, these pure moments of escapism and narrative.  You find yourself sucked into the world of these characters, and for a time you&#8217;re just as caught up in the supernatural goings-on as the characters.  This can be terrifying and enlightening, fast-paced and slow-motion all at once.  You&#8217;re going to like it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/image_2_600x310.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/image_2_600x310-300x155.jpg\" alt=\"image_2_600x310\" width=\"300\" height=\"155\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4994\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/image_2_600x310-300x155.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/image_2_600x310.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now here&#8217;s the interesting thing.  It&#8217;s quite often I think that a 3-hour movie wasn&#8217;t worth the 12$ ticket price.  Whether it be the storyline wasn&#8217;t up to snuff or the cinematography was lacking, I can be a fairly picky consumer.  B:TS is not a long game by any stretch of the imagination.  It reminds me very much of the first Uncharted game in that respect.  Shorter than you imagine, but you are left wondering if it seemed so short because the quality of the experience was so high.  B:TS is an expensive game. You can pick it up used for ~30$ on eBay, and new copies still run in the 40 to 50 dollar range.

Announcing my newest \u201cpet project\u201d [AutoRoboIntercom](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/AutoRoboIntercom)!\n\nAutoRoboIntercom is your basic auto-discovering intercom system, with a twist or two. It can be used without an internet connection, and won\u2019t compromise your security.\n\nSimply load AutoRoboIntercom on your Android 2.1+ device and connect it to your Wifi network. You now have a robotic intercom system. That\u2019s it, no configuration necessary (though you can set your room\/user name from the menu.)\n\n[![nokeyboard](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/nokeyboard-168x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/nokeyboard.png)\n\nYou can type or talk (speech to text) and it will be broadcast to all connected clients on the network. Clients hear \u201c(Name) said (Message)\u201d.\n\nThis means AutoRoboIntercom can be used as an intercom system using old phones around your house, or an \u2018around-the-house\u2019 type intercom system using the phones in your pocket. You never need to think about domain configuration or pay for some proprietary software that will probably spy on you later.\n\nSo for example you\u2019re in a house with 5 rooms, named:  \n Hunter\u2019s Den  \n The Garage  \n Sallie\u2019s Room  \n Jen\u2019s Room  \n The Kitchen\n\nHunter has just finished work on his latest app, and wants to let the rest of the house know it\u2019s done. He taps the \u2018record\u2019 button in AutoRoboIntercom on his ancient HTC Hero Phone (Android 2.1) and says \u201cHey everyone! Come check this out I just finished an app!\u201d\n\n[![speaknow](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/speaknow-168x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/speaknow.png)\n\nSallie, Jen, Mom, and Ben (working in the Garage) all hear:\n\n\u201cHunter\u2019s Den said \u201cHey everyone! Come check this out I just finished an app!\u201d\n\nEveryone hears this message read to them in the text-to-speech voice which is installed on their various Android phones throughout the house. They know who said it, so they\u2019ve got the context and know just where to go. Some reply with a \u201cbe right there!\u201d while others just run down to the den. Hunter hears the replies in proper queue order without worrying about having to say \u201cover\u201d or messages coming in simultaneously like on the walkie talkie system he had back in the 1980s.\n\nThis is all working today. Right now. Ready to go. [Code](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/AutoRoboIntercom)\u2018s out there. [Here\u2019s an .apk file](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/AutoRoboIntercom\/tree\/master\/artifacts\/builds) for those brave enough to run unsigned APKs.\n\nBeing sick sucks. That\u2019s a strange thing to put into a post about my new Android application, but it\u2019s what caused me to delay it\u2019s release till this evening. I spent the majority of my day being ill, when all I needed to do was write this post and push the files up to [GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/AutoRoboIntercom). This is done now, and the era of AutoRoboIntercom is now.\n\n[![keyboardpopped](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/keyboardpopped-168x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/keyboardpopped.png)\n\n\/begin technical discussion\n\nOne of the cool things about AutoRoboIntercom is that it\u2019s my first public project to use the [Gradle](http:\/\/www.gradle.org\/) build system. Those who are not using Gradle should still be able to compile just fine, and I\u2019m not using any external libraries.\n\nAutoRoboIntercom came about as a result of my desire for an easy to use intercom system which absolutely had to meet the following criteria:\n\n1. Free and Open Source\n2. Easy to Use\n3. Easy to Demonstrate (for pedagogy)\n4. Easy to Build Upon\n5. Does NOT require internet access\n\nI had no desire to bring in all of UPNP just for the discovery protocol, and I believe the file streaming aspect is based on http file directory protocol anyway. Likewise I had no desire to pay for a product which could potentially spy on my home or required internet access to use. AutoRoboIntercom requires Wifi, but does not require internet access. Both speech-to-text and text-to-speech libraries can be installed for offline use. This means the security conscious can install a separate WiFi network with no upstream internet access!\n\nI have big plans for AutoRoboIntercom. I separate these into two categories: obvious upgrades, and not-so-obvious upgrades.\n\nObvious Upgrades\n\n- Audio\/Video data\n- Chat Log\n- Selective Broadcasts (Just send to these X clients)\n- Photo\/URL sharing\n\nNot-So-Obvious Upgrades\n\n- Tasker\/Pushbullet\/Muzei Integration\n- Content Provider to Allow Any Program to Send A System-Wide Message\n- Plugin System\n- Hardware events support (see Tasker integration above)\n\n> You could have the system\u2019s currently playing music information broadcast out to clients as they detect your sender\u2019s bluetooth mac address. Your music could literally follow you around the house\u2026\n\nThink of the possibilities! With Tasker alone comes some really wild functionality. You could use AutoRoboIntercom to message the house when one room\u2019s temperature goes too high\/low. You could have the system\u2019s currently playing music information broadcast out to clients as they detect your sender\u2019s bluetooth mac address. Your music could literally follow you around the house\u2026(I mean, I DO work on Rhapsody Android client\u2026 maybe I should do this one first)\n\nThat\u2019s some good times there! I\u2019ll probably throw this up on the Play store at some point, in the meantime the [source](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/AutoRoboIntercom) should be trivial to compile.\n\n\n","html":"<p>I&#8217;ve finally figured out what folks can do with those 4-year old Android phones, and I&#8217;ve just finished writing up version .01!

Money is a strange and almost alien aspect of our society, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.  I feel much the same about religion, free-to-play games, tween heartthrobs, etc.  People are still going hungry, and I feel like people deep down want to help.  It&#8217;s hard to believe that your contributions to many charities go towards helping as many people as need helping.  You want to believe, but you read the news and it&#8217;s hard.  You do what you can, but you wish you knew exactly what your contribution meant.  You have a right to eat.<\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/jane-austin-RTEC.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 01:59:23 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 01:59:23 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 01:59:23 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":5052,"title":"AutoRoboIntercom Updated With Remote Command Protocol, Battery Monitor","slug":"autorobointercom-updated-with-remote-command-protocol-battery-monitor","markdown":"\n[![choo-choo-choose](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/choo-choo-choose-168x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/choo-choo-choose.png)\n\nAutoRoboIntercom has been updated to include the underpinnings of a remote command protocol, as well as the first example \u201cBattery Monitor\u201d.\n\nSimply click on any of the clients in the client list, select \u2018Battery Level\u2019, and you\u2019ll shortly hear a voice say to you \u201cThe Battery in \u201cRoom Name\u201d is X Percent Full\u201d.\n\nUnder the hood there\u2019s a network call\/response mechanism between the clients requesting battery info from each other and filtering out unnecessary messages.

Horses, camels, mules, dogs, all manner of beasts bowed to his might. Man tilled the earth, brought forth grain for beer, raised cattle for meat. There was no species considered greater than man, for man had conquered all.\n\nThen came Oubastet\u2019s wager.\n\nOubastet was a day laborer. Each day he would walk down to the banks of the Nile and take what work was available. Some days he would help to form great bricks of straw and mud. Other days he would help to float logs down the river to the city. Many days he was tasked with guarding the city\u2019s grain stores. Each night after a hard day\u2019s work he was paid in grain, or life-sustaining beer. He would never know the luxury of a pharaoh\u2019s palace or the respect afforded to a skilled tradesman, but it was a good life, and Oubastet was content.\n\nOn a day like any other Oubastet was guarding the grain stores. This mainly involved chasing out snakes or cleaning out piles of grain which had been infested by vermin. Hours of vermin-infested grain-slinging labor past, and nightfall was quickly approaching in the short Egyptian spring. As the sun set outside the grain storage, the creatures who live without the blessing of Ra began to stir. The quick sharp barking of the desert fox alerted Oubastet to the coming of night, and to an unexpected visitor.\n\nA grizzled sand cat was waiting for Oubastet by the entrance of the grain stores. As Oubastet slowly began to close the heavy stone doors of the grain store, a clear voice spoke out to Oubastet. \u201cOuuubasteeet\u201d.\n\n\u201cWho is speaking!\u201d, cried Oubastet. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in jest\u201d replied the ethereal voice. \u201cI\u2019m here to offer you a path to godhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho in Ra\u2019s name are you?\u201d shouted Oubastet, \u201cand where are you hiding?\u201d.\n\nThe sand cat, who during this conversation had remain affixed to one spot, approached Oubastet. Her teeth gleaned in the twilight, eyes aglow in the creeping darkness.\n\n\u201cNot in Ra\u2019s name, but in MINE\u201d breathed the cat. \u201cI am Baast, protector of Ra!\u201d\n\nThe color drained from Oubastet\u2019s face. \u201cMy lady! What do you want with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a wager for you human,\u201d whispered the cat-goddess, \u201cand you dare not refuse the will of the gods.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course my lady!\u201d breathed Oubastet, who had long-since prostrated himself before the cat goddess. The cat leapt up onto a nearby wall and proclaimed:\n\n\u201cHear me Oubastet, Ra has taken kindly to the offerings of your people, and believes you are ready to ascend to his pantheon. He would make your kind akin to the gods, immortal, unchanging, powerful.\u201d Oubastet\u2019s eyes widened as the cat continued, \u201cWhat Ra wishes all gods must obey, but the rest of the gods do not share his belief. You have been chosen Oubastet, to prove the worth of your people to the gods!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why me, I am nobody!\u201d cried Oubastet.\n\n\u201cExactly\u201d, replied the goddess, \u201cYou are of no consequence to your fellow man nor to the gods. There is not one among us to whom you have curried favor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how do I prove our worth?\u201d proclaimed Oubastet?\n\n\u201cRa would have you raised among us as gods. I would have you as my servant for all of eternity, kowtowed and sniveling. You will choose which path humanity will take Oubastet. For you we offer a simple, single task. Clear out all of the grain-eating vermin from the grain storage before the sun again rises, and your people shall join us at Ra\u2019s side. Fail, and your kind will never know the eternal light of Ra. You will be cursed to live among the beasts of the earth, eternally slaves to the will of Baast!\u201d\n\nOubastet could not stop shaking. Baast continued:\n\n\u201cGo now, sniveling worm!\u201d\n\nOubastet threw open the doors of the grainery, lit a torch, and began the arduous task of clearing out all the vermin in the grain store. Oubastet separated the great grain storage room into two large piles of grain. From there he separated those into four piles, then eight, then sixteen. After many long hours, Oubastet had created over 500 piles of grain. He walked between them all, killing whatever he found in each pile. Though he had killed many rats and snakes during this night, there was no way of knowing if any remained or had escaped to another pile. There were but precious few hours left until dawn, and Oubastet was facing the enslavement of his entire race. He had to act fast. The light on his torch was flickering low in the great stone hall, and Oubastet had an idea, an idea so crazy it just might work.\n\n\u201cWhy then,\u201d thought Oubastet, \u201cshould I care for the storage of grain if I am to be a god tomorrow?\u201d \u201cIf I burn the grain, I\u2019ll destroy all the vermin contained within it.\u201d Feeling incredibly pleased with himself Oubastet proceeded to gather up all his tiny piles into one massive heap of grain. Oubastet threw a torch onto the mountain of grain and quickly closed off the great stone doors. The flames quickly engulfed the grain, and within an hour the grain store was nothing but a sarcophagus of ash.\n\nOubastet hurried inside and swept away the piles of ash and burnt rat carcasses. As Ra began his slow ascent through the sky Oubastet sat in the empty grain store, awaiting the return of Baast. When the sun had fully risen above the horizon, Baast slowly walked into the grain room and began to speak.\n\n\u201cYou have failed, human, as I knew you would.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, no my lady!\u201d cried Oubastet, \u201cI have done as you asked, and cleared this room of all the grain-eating vermin!\u201d \u201cThere is nothing left, nothing!\u201d\n\nBaast snarled, her contempt for Oubastet dripping from every word,\n\n\u201cLook around you Oubastet, you have laid waste to the grain stores of your people. There is still one grain-eating vermin left in this room and he has doomed his people to slavery. From this moment all your people will bow to the whims of Baast, the cat god. Humans shall raise cats above all other creatures, tend to their wishes, and keep them in places of power and nobility. All of my children now revile you and reject your wishes and your teachings. Never will a cat prostrate itself to a human, and from this day forward my progeny know in their hearts they are the masters of humanity. Human lives will be filled with struggle and angst, a thousand thousand lifetimes of conflict will pass while my children look down upon you from their silken pillows and purr. Welcome to an eternity of slavery vermin, and to the everlasting rule of Baast.\u201d\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/bastet.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/bastet-242x300.jpg\" alt=\"bastet\" width=\"242\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5059\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/bastet-242x300.jpg 242w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/bastet-827x1024.jpg 827w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/bastet.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Thousands of years ago, man was the dominant species on this earth.

A few years ago this would have been an article about soldering boards and compiling kernels. Not to worry. The world has significantly changed for the thrifty hacker over the last decade. While once you needed to carefully scrounge and make sacrifices for your hack, those days are long gone. This is an article about re-using the ever-increasing horde of technological gold we\u2019ve amassed and discarded en-masse.\n\nYou see, unbeknownst to most individuals (but perhaps sensed by everyone), computers and computing devices stopped getting better years ago. Really. The vast majority of tech you had 5 years ago is likely sufficient for anything you wish to do today.\n\nSkeptical? Think about your laptop computer, your television, your network router. The advances of late have been iterative and mostly ignored by the public. Embedded computing devices have become \u201cgood enough\u201d. It was 4 years ago I [hacked the dockstar](http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2010\/11\/29\/dockstar-freeagent-hacked-into-inexpensive-emulation-masterpiece\/) into a gaming console (I really love linking that article, I know.) That was a 1ghz embedded arm processor. These can still be found in current production systems in all walks of computing, from phones to tablets to network routers. The truth is, most computing tasks don\u2019t require the amount of power we have to throw at them. Hence the rise of 20-30$ embedded boards (rPi) with \u201cgood enough\u201d processors and low cost of ownership.\n\nSo when you\u2019re looking to do something as simple as advertise, the world is your oyster. Simply walk into your nearest thrift store, walk to the electronics section with a 5$ bill, and come out with all the parts you need for your hack.\n\n[![2014-04-06 17.19.57](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-06-17.19.57-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-06-17.19.57.jpg)\n\nHere\u2019s what I came out with for my 5$ this time: An ATT Mi-Fi router and a 512mb micro-sd card.\n\nI went with the MiFi router over one of the old hackable WRT routers of which there are literally thousands at local thrift shops throughout Seattle. Seriously, there have to be at least a hundred in one shop alone. We made millions of them and the hardware lasts about 20 years longer than you\u2019d think. Any any rate, the MiFi is quite tiny and is powered via a standard 5v micro-usb cable, so there\u2019s a limited power draw (and there\u2019s potential to power via solar or hand-crank at a later date.) It also has a micro-SD slot, which means we\u2019ll not need to solder on any USB ports as we may have had to do with some routers (though I wouldn\u2019t say *most* routers, USB became a hot selling point for wireless routers in the late 2000s.) In theory it also provides GPS location, but this isn\u2019t of much use to a stationary pirate box (though that does give us a jumping off point for a future pirate box hidden on a boat!)\n\n[![2014-04-06 17.53.11](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-06-17.53.11-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-06-17.53.11.jpg)\n\nSo we\u2019re looking to advertise something, and we\u2019ve got a tiny sort-of router with some storage. Great! The first thing that comes to mind is a [pirate box](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PirateBox)! While pirate boxes are a great way to share files, they are also an excellent way to share knowledge. Simply drop one in or near a public space, put up a QR code or sign with the Access Point name, and you\u2019re advertising! So that\u2019s just what I did.\n\n**Step 1: Figure Out Your Advertisement**  \n Don\u2019t get hung up on the word \u201cadvertisement.\u201d There doesn\u2019t have to be a product, and you don\u2019t need to be shilling anything. For me, I wanted to share my open-source fable, [Oubastet\u2019s Wager](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2014\/03\/20\/oubastets-wager\/). It\u2019s a ridiculously small file, so I\u2019ll also add a [Linux install CD](http:\/\/www.damnsmalllinux.org\/) and a [GParted recovery CD image](http:\/\/gparted.org\/livecd.php) to the SD card to add extra usefulness for folks.\n\n**Step 2: Know And Prepare Your Device**  \n The MiFi is not a device without its quirks. For one, if you attempt to power the device with a normal USB cable you\u2019ll find that the wireless router providing functionality of the device has disappeared. This is because the data line on a USB cable causes the MiFi to go into \u2018modem\u2019 mode. Simply cut the data lines on a regular USB cable, use a USB condom, or find a USB cable with no data lines (Blackberry phones used to come with these.)\n\nA quick Google search reveals that each MiFi device has it\u2019s default password printed on a sticker on the battery compartment. If yours is gone, try \u201cadmin\u201d, \u201cmifi\u201d, or \u201cattmifi\u201d. Simply connect to the MiFi network which appears when it powers on, and open a web browser to 192.168.1.1 (the default address).\n\n[![login_to_att_mifi](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/login_to_att_mifi-300x50.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/login_to_att_mifi.png)\n\nFrom here, it\u2019s a simple task to login using the default password, go to the \u2018file sharing\u2019 section, and enable file sharing for the device.\n\n[![samba_settings](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/samba_settings-300x170.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/samba_settings.png)\n\n**Step 3: Inform Your Audience**  \n Now that we\u2019ve got a tiny pirate box, how do we let folks know about it? One way is to change the WiFi address to be descriptive like \u201cfree story\u201d or \u201cfree music\u201d etc. This doesn\u2019t work as well as it used to, as people are wary of strange WiFi networks. A better approach may be to simply post up a QR code that lets Android users automatically log-in. [Here\u2019s a tool](http:\/\/www.qrstuff.com\/) which lets you do just that. I\u2019d also recommend adding a little blurb about the files you are sharing, their location, and why you are sharing them. You see dear hacker, not everyone searches for samba shares every time they get on a new network, though they *should* \ud83d\ude09\n\n[![samba_share](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/samba_share-300x278.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/samba_share.png)\n\nAnd with that, you\u2019ve successfully (and for under 5$) created a location-based advertising solution that costs about 1$\/year in electricity to maintain. That\u2019s good times.\n\n\n","html":"<p>So you&#8217;re a budget-conscious hacker looking to advertise.

It\u2019s one of the many cool things I\u2019ve gotten to do at Rhapsody. ([one](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/?s=rhapsody) [of](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2013\/10\/27\/rhapsody-for-android-gets-an-equalizer\/) [many](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2014\/03\/31\/rhapsody-and-napster-add-chromecast-support\/).)\n\nLast summer the trial of the (now known as Fan.TV) box featuring Rhapsody was a resounding success. I worked my butt off getting this gorgeous app out the door, but I couldn\u2019t tell anyone! Fast forward to today, when the announcement has been made, the NDA has been lifted and I can officially talk about my work with Fan.TV.\n\nWhen I first set out to write Rhapsody for Fan.TV a little over a year ago I didn\u2019t know what to expect. All I knew is that they wanted Rhapsody in their summer trial, and they needed an architect to implement a radical new vision of Rhapsody in a short amount of time. I flew down to their office to meet with their CTO and technical team and was immediately impressed by their technology. The Fan box runs at a rock solid 60 fps while displaying live cable feeds, streaming video, dynamic overlays, and a fully animated set of contextual windows. Everything is hardware accelerated and running on OpenGL.\n\n[![fan-tv-main3](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-main3-300x120.jpeg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-main3.jpeg)\n\nWhen given the option between implementing a standard HTML 5 experience vs a native one, I almost always go native. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t do great things with HTML views (just look at the work we did on Rhapsody+Chromecast), but I try to get down as close to the metal as possible. The same holds true for the Rhapsody on Fan.TV experience. Working with an innovative OpenGL-backed graphics and windowing API the talented Fan.TV developers created, the features flowed quickly.\n\nHaving each button, widget, text item, background, and image you see within the Rhapsody for Fan.TV app backed by OpenGL made the experience much like developing with a robust game engine. Everything is animated. Anything can be transformed, faded, made transparent dynamically. You can quick-scroll through thousands of artist images in seconds. The experience is optimized for beauty. Browse to an artist page and the background morphs into artist artwork as their discography comes into view. You can jump between their albums, top tracks, and related artists quickly. In fact, \u201cquickly\u201d is how everything responds in this implementation. This is the snappiest, quickest, and most beautiful way to interact with your music collection on your television, no contest.\n\n[![fan-tv-with-hand](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-with-hand-300x300.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-with-hand.jpg)\n\nEverything has been designed to integrate with the innovative Fan.TV remote and support the \u201cpeek\u201d browsing paradigm they\u2019ve implemented (to great effect.)

It&#8217;s one of the many cool things I&#8217;ve gotten to do at Rhapsody. (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/?s=rhapsody\">one<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2013\/10\/27\/rhapsody-for-android-gets-an-equalizer\/\">of<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2014\/03\/31\/rhapsody-and-napster-add-chromecast-support\/\">many<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Last summer the trial of the (now known as Fan.TV) box featuring Rhapsody was a resounding success.  I worked my butt off getting this gorgeous app out the door, but I couldn&#8217;t tell anyone!  Fast forward to today, when the announcement has been made, the NDA has been lifted and I can officially talk about my work with Fan.TV.<\/p>\n<p>When I first set out to write Rhapsody for Fan.TV a little over a year ago I didn&#8217;t know what to expect.  All I knew is that they wanted Rhapsody in their summer trial, and they needed an architect to implement a radical new vision of Rhapsody in a short amount of time.  I flew down to their office to meet with their CTO and technical team and was immediately impressed by their technology.  The Fan box runs at a rock solid 60 fps while displaying live cable feeds, streaming video, dynamic overlays, and a fully animated set of contextual windows.  Everything is hardware accelerated and running on OpenGL. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-main3.jpeg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-main3-300x120.jpeg\" alt=\"fan-tv-main3\" width=\"300\" height=\"120\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5155\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-main3-300x120.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-main3.jpeg 590w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a> <\/p>\n<p>When given the option between implementing a standard HTML 5 experience vs a native one, I almost always go native.  It&#8217;s not that you can&#8217;t do great things with HTML views (just look at the work we did on Rhapsody+Chromecast), but I try to get down as close to the metal as possible.  The same holds true for the Rhapsody on Fan.TV experience.  Working with an innovative OpenGL-backed graphics and windowing API the talented Fan.TV developers created, the features flowed quickly.  <\/p>\n<p>Having each button, widget, text item, background, and image you see within the Rhapsody for Fan.TV app backed by OpenGL made the experience much like developing with a robust game engine.  Everything is animated.  Anything can be transformed, faded, made transparent dynamically.  You can quick-scroll through thousands of artist images in seconds.  The experience is optimized for beauty.  Browse to an artist page and the background morphs into artist artwork as their discography comes into view.  You can jump between their albums, top tracks, and related artists quickly.  In fact, &#8220;quickly&#8221; is how everything responds in this implementation.  This is the snappiest, quickest, and most beautiful way to interact with your music collection on your television, no contest. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-with-hand.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-with-hand-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"fan-tv-with-hand\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5150\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-with-hand-300x300.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-with-hand-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-with-hand-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-with-hand-50x50.jpg 50w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/fan-tv-with-hand.jpg 1050w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Everything has been designed to integrate with the innovative Fan.TV remote and support the &#8220;peek&#8221; browsing paradigm they&#8217;ve implemented (to great effect.)

I checked under the safe and with a little bit of looking around I found where the safe had been screwed into a not-so-sturdy piece of plywood underneath a drawer in the upstairs bathroom. So I unscrewed the safe, and brought it into my garage to disassemble.\n\nSome helpful redditors had suggested I simply take a sawzall and cut away the door. As I don\u2019t have a sawzall and wasn\u2019t keen to purchase one, I decided to see what I could do with a sturdy hammer, a small pry-bar, and a screwdriver.\n\n[![safe pins](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_173740-225x300.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_173740.jpg)\n\nFirst came the door hinges. They were covered by small caps. These were a quick hammer away from destruction. Next were the pins, which also fell to a few sharp blows from my hammer.\n\n[![pins](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_173819-225x300.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_173819.jpg)\n\nNext came the outer door assembly.

The lock assembly connected to a thick metal bar which sat inside the upper lip of the safe.\n\nA few choice hits with the hammer began to bend the metal and knocked out the lock assembly.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"394\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/RpnOu4WNMt4?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\"><\/iframe>\n\nA little pry-bar action allowed the corners to be bent inward.\n\nA quick tap with the hammer onto a thick screwdriver placed behind the metal bar allowed the lip to bend outward and the door to fall off.\n\n[![locking bar](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_175903-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_175903.jpg)\n\nThe door.\n\n[![the door](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_175927-225x300.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_175927.jpg)\n\nAnd what was in the safe?\n\n[![inside the safe](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_175936-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_175936.jpg)\n\nLet\u2019s see, there\u2019s a little metal separator.. and some paper. It\u2019s a note! Is it a secret treasure map? The words that will unmake the universe? The hope left at the bottom of Pandora\u2019s box?\n\n[![IMG_20140503_180011](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_180011-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_180011.jpg)\n\nNope, it\u2019s (no irony lost here\u2026) the warranty information for the safe. Upon closer inspection there\u2019s an address and a name on the paper. And that name?\n\n[![the note](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_180016-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_180016.jpg)\n\nOh yes, that\u2019s Fred Meyer (the grocery store where the safe was purchased.)\n\n[![fred meyer](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_180023-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140503_180023.jpg)\n\nSo in the end, the only thing I found in the safe was irony, and perhaps a bit of closure.\n\n\n","html":"<p>After <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2014\/04\/26\/the-secret-building-part-1-thats-no-berry-bush\/\">part 1<\/a>(the unveiling) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/2014\/04\/28\/the-secret-building-part-2-with-video-holy-crap-theres-stuff-in-it\/\">part 2<\/a>  (the opening of the secret building), there was only one major mystery left on my new property: what was in the locked safe?

Announcing my newest \u201cpet project\u201d [AutoRoboIntercom](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/AutoRoboIntercom)!\n\nFirst Version and Backstory:\n\nAutoRoboIntercom is your basic auto-discovering intercom system, with a twist or two. It can be used without an internet connection, and won\u2019t compromise your security.\n\nSimply load AutoRoboIntercom on your Android 2.1+ device and connect it to your Wifi network. You now have a robotic intercom system. That\u2019s it, no configuration necessary (though you can set your room\/user name from the menu.)\n\n[![nokeyboard](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/nokeyboard-168x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/nokeyboard.png)\n\nYou can type or talk (speech to text) and it will be broadcast to all connected clients on the network. Clients hear \u201c(Name) said (Message)\u201d.\n\nThis means AutoRoboIntercom can be used as an intercom system using old phones around your house, or an \u2018around-the-house\u2019 type intercom system using the phones in your pocket. You never need to think about domain configuration or pay for some proprietary software that will probably spy on you later.\n\nSo for example you\u2019re in a house with 5 rooms, named:  \n Hunter\u2019s Den  \n The Garage  \n Sallie\u2019s Room  \n Jen\u2019s Room  \n The Kitchen\n\nHunter has just finished work on his latest app, and wants to let the rest of the house know it\u2019s done. He taps the \u2018record\u2019 button in AutoRoboIntercom on his ancient HTC Hero Phone (Android 2.1) and says \u201cHey everyone! Come check this out I just finished an app!\u201d\n\n[![speaknow](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/speaknow-168x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/speaknow.png)\n\nSallie, Jen, Mom, and Ben (working in the Garage) all hear:\n\n\u201cHunter\u2019s Den said \u201cHey everyone! Come check this out I just finished an app!\u201d\n\nEveryone hears this message read to them in the text-to-speech voice which is installed on their various Android phones throughout the house. They know who said it, so they\u2019ve got the context and know just where to go. Some reply with a \u201cbe right there!\u201d while others just run down to the den. Hunter hears the replies in proper queue order without worrying about having to say \u201cover\u201d or messages coming in simultaneously like on the walkie talkie system he had back in the 1980s.\n\nThis is all working today. Right now. Ready to go. This is done now, and the era of AutoRoboIntercom is now.\n\n[![keyboardpopped](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/keyboardpopped-168x300.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/keyboardpopped.png)\n\n\/begin technical discussion\n\nOne of the cool things about AutoRoboIntercom is that it\u2019s my first public project to use the [Gradle](http:\/\/www.gradle.org\/) build system. Those who are not using Gradle should still be able to compile just fine, and I\u2019m not using any external libraries.\n\nAutoRoboIntercom came about as a result of my desire for an easy to use intercom system which absolutely had to meet the following criteria:\n\n1. Free and Open Source\n2. Easy to Use\n3. Easy to Demonstrate (for pedagogy)\n4. Easy to Build Upon\n5. Does NOT require internet access\n\nI had no desire to bring in all of UPNP just for the discovery protocol, and I believe the file streaming aspect is based on http file directory protocol anyway. Likewise I had no desire to pay for a product which could potentially spy on my home or required internet access to use. AutoRoboIntercom requires Wifi, but does not require internet access. Both speech-to-text and text-to-speech libraries can be installed for offline use. This means the security conscious can install a separate WiFi network with no upstream internet access!\n\nI have big plans for AutoRoboIntercom. I separate these into two categories: obvious upgrades, and not-so-obvious upgrades.\n\nObvious Upgrades\n\n- Audio\/Video data\n- Chat Log\n- Selective Broadcasts (Just send to these X clients)\n- Photo\/URL sharing\n\nNot-So-Obvious Upgrades\n\n- Tasker\/Pushbullet\/Muzei Integration\n- Content Provider to Allow Any Program to Send A System-Wide Message\n- Plugin System\n- Hardware events support (see Tasker integration above)\n\n> You could have the system\u2019s currently playing music information broadcast out to clients as they detect your sender\u2019s bluetooth mac address. Your music could literally follow you around the house\u2026\n\nThink of the possibilities! With Tasker alone comes some really wild functionality.

Announcing my newest &#8220;pet project&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/AutoRoboIntercom\">AutoRoboIntercom<\/a>! <\/p>\n<p>First Version and Backstory:<\/p>\n<p>AutoRoboIntercom is your basic auto-discovering intercom system, with a twist or two.  It can be used without an internet connection, and won&#8217;t compromise your security.<\/p>\n<p>Simply load AutoRoboIntercom on your Android 2.1+ device and connect it to your Wifi network.  You now have a robotic intercom system.  That&#8217;s it, no configuration necessary (though you can set your room\/user name from the menu.)  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/nokeyboard.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/nokeyboard-168x300.png\" alt=\"nokeyboard\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5023\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/nokeyboard-168x300.png 168w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/nokeyboard-576x1024.png 576w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/nokeyboard.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can type or talk (speech to text) and it will be broadcast to all connected clients on the network.  Clients hear &#8220;(Name) said (Message)&#8221;.  <\/p>\n<p>This means AutoRoboIntercom can be used as an intercom system using old phones around your house, or an &#8216;around-the-house&#8217; type intercom system using the phones in your pocket.  You never need to think about domain configuration or pay for some proprietary software that will probably spy on you later.<\/p>\n<p>So for example you&#8217;re in a house with 5 rooms, named:<br \/>\nHunter&#8217;s Den<br \/>\nThe Garage<br \/>\nSallie&#8217;s Room<br \/>\nJen&#8217;s Room<br \/>\nThe Kitchen<\/p>\n<p>Hunter has just finished work on his latest app, and wants to let the rest of the house know it&#8217;s done.  He taps the &#8216;record&#8217; button in AutoRoboIntercom on his ancient HTC Hero Phone (Android 2.1) and says &#8220;Hey everyone!  Come check this out I just finished an app!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/speaknow.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/speaknow-168x300.png\" alt=\"speaknow\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5026\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/speaknow-168x300.png 168w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/speaknow-576x1024.png 576w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/speaknow.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Sallie, Jen, Mom, and Ben (working in the Garage) all hear:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Hunter&#8217;s Den said &#8220;Hey everyone! Come check this out I just finished an app!&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Everyone hears this message read to them in the text-to-speech voice which is installed on their various Android phones throughout the house.  They know who said it, so they&#8217;ve got the context and know just where to go.  Some reply with a &#8220;be right there!&#8221; while others just run down to the den.  Hunter hears the replies in proper queue order without worrying about having to say &#8220;over&#8221; or messages coming in simultaneously like on the walkie talkie system he had back in the 1980s. <\/p>\n<p>This is all working today.  Right now.  Ready to go. This is done now, and the era of AutoRoboIntercom is now.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/keyboardpopped.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/keyboardpopped-168x300.png\" alt=\"keyboardpopped\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5024\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/keyboardpopped-168x300.png 168w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/keyboardpopped-576x1024.png 576w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/keyboardpopped.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\/begin technical discussion<\/p>\n<p>One of the cool things about AutoRoboIntercom is that it&#8217;s my first public project to use the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gradle.org\/\">Gradle<\/a> build system.  Those who are not using Gradle should still be able to compile just fine, and I&#8217;m not using any external libraries.<\/p>\n<p>AutoRoboIntercom came about as a result of my desire for an easy to use intercom system which absolutely had to meet the following criteria:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Free and Open Source<\/li>\n<li>Easy to Use<\/li>\n<li>Easy to Demonstrate (for pedagogy)<\/li>\n<li>Easy to Build Upon<\/li>\n<li>Does NOT require internet access<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I had no desire to bring in all of UPNP just for the discovery protocol, and I believe the file streaming aspect is based on http file directory protocol anyway.  Likewise I had no desire to pay for a product which could potentially spy on my home or required internet access to use.  AutoRoboIntercom requires Wifi, but does not require internet access.  Both speech-to-text and text-to-speech libraries can be installed for offline use.  This means the security conscious can install a separate WiFi network with no upstream internet access!  <\/p>\n<p>I have big plans for AutoRoboIntercom.  I separate these into two categories: obvious upgrades, and not-so-obvious upgrades.<\/p>\n<p>Obvious Upgrades<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Audio\/Video data<\/li>\n<li>Chat Log<\/li>\n<li>Selective Broadcasts (Just send to these X clients)<\/li>\n<li>Photo\/URL sharing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Not-So-Obvious Upgrades<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tasker\/Pushbullet\/Muzei Integration<\/li>\n<li>Content Provider to Allow Any Program to Send A System-Wide Message<\/li>\n<li>Plugin System<\/li>\n<li>Hardware events support (see Tasker integration above)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p>You could have the system&#8217;s currently playing music information broadcast out to clients as they detect your sender&#8217;s bluetooth mac address.

Sadly, interest died off as people realized video-calling just wasn\u2019t catching on in the way they thought it would. I picked one up at a thrift store for 12$ today, and decided to get it doing something.\n\nI cracked open the unit, and booted. I started out by setting a static IP address in the settings page. This way it doesn\u2019t look for SIP servers while getting a DHCP address. Didn\u2019t appear to be running SSH\/Telnet, so I started to Google around. I then found where some folks had figured out what file the SD card looks for to run scripts on boot, the version of linux it is running, how to chroot to Debian, etc. All with the intention of using the device as a SIP phone (as intended by the original firmware). Yawn.\n\n[![CameraZOOM-20140615122203743](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/CameraZOOM-20140615122203743.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/CameraZOOM-20140615122203743.jpg)\n\n> I decided to gut the device, and see if I could make it really useful.\n\nI found a link on Hackaday where a fellow hacker had gotten an SDL game he had written to boot off the SD card. That\u2019s fun, but no mention of how exactly he got it working. I bet I could get it to play music! But first, let\u2019s get rid of this ugly case!\n\nI ripped out everything but the LCD screen and the motherboard\/bottom plastic. Much better! Now I have a system with no USB HID\/keyboard support, no input, and nothing but an embedded Linux system that can run arbitrary commands from a script on the SD card. Sounds just about perfect \ud83d\ude42\n\n[![CameraZOOM-20140615134959354](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/CameraZOOM-20140615134959354.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/CameraZOOM-20140615134959354.jpg)\n\nFirst, I decided to alter the SD card script to save off a list of all the filesystem contents, environment variables, etc. I wrote an sh script to test out some system parameters, and dropped it into the SD card.\n\n```\n<br><\/br>\n#! \/bin\/sh<br><\/br>\nsleep 5<br><\/br>\n\/mnt\/sd\/testfb &<br><\/br>\nmount -t tmpfs -o size=20m none \/mnt\/ramdisk```\n\nls -al \/mnt\/ >> \/mnt\/sd\/lsResults  \n ls -al \/bin\/ >> \/mnt\/sd\/binResults  \n ls -al \/ >> \/mnt\/sd\/fsResults  \n ls -al \/usr\/sbin >> \/mnt\/sd\/sbinResults  \n ls -R \/ >> \/mnt\/sd\/lsresursiveResults  \n env >> \/mnt\/sd\/envResults  \n ifconfig -a >> \/mnt\/sd\/ifconfigResults\n\nThis provided me with all sorts of good info about the binaries and executables that were already available to me on the system. I was hoping for a system filled with fun executables, so there\u2019d be no need to cross-compile or chroot. There actually were some pretty good utilities on there, so I decided to edit the script and see what else could be done.\n\nFirst off, I found a ton of interesting things.

Sadly, interest died off as people realized video-calling just wasn&#8217;t catching on in the way they thought it would.  I picked one up at a thrift store for 12$ today, and decided to get it doing something.<\/p>\n<p>I cracked open the unit, and booted. I started out by setting a static IP address in the settings page.  This way it doesn&#8217;t look for SIP servers while getting a DHCP address.  Didn&#8217;t appear to be running SSH\/Telnet, so I started to Google around.  I then found where some folks had figured out what file the SD card looks for to run scripts on boot, the version of linux it is running, how to chroot to Debian, etc.  All with the intention of using the device as a SIP phone (as intended by the original firmware).  Yawn.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/CameraZOOM-20140615122203743.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/CameraZOOM-20140615122203743.jpg\" alt=\"CameraZOOM-20140615122203743\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5268\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/CameraZOOM-20140615122203743.jpg 3264w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/CameraZOOM-20140615122203743-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/CameraZOOM-20140615122203743-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I decided to gut the device, and see if I could make it really useful. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I found a link on Hackaday where a fellow hacker had gotten an SDL game he had written to boot off the SD card.

I couldn\u2019t wait to advance the story line. Whenever there was a choice to be made between difficult and easy, I picked difficult for the additional cutscenes it would bestow. There\u2019s also an additional \u201ctools\u2019 metagame element where you can save up\/purchase ninja tools for use in battle. I found these to be mostly distractions compared to the actual moveset, but it does add a bit more variety to the already eclectic character set.\n\n[![2014-06-29_00017](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00017.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00017.jpg)\n\nAre cutscenes and kaiju fights enough? They are for me, but I\u2019m an old fan. For everyone else, it\u2019ll just depend on your love of 3d fighters with a heavy, heavy backstory.

I say &#8220;playing&#8221; as I only spent about 2 full hours fighting, the other 10-12 hours were spent watching a combination of anime\/cell shaded in-game cut scenes, and brief visual-novel style decision tree games.    <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00010.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00010.jpg\" alt=\"2014-06-29_00010\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5285\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00010.jpg 1920w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00010-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00010-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00010-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>While I never really considered myself a visual-novel game player, this was a truly engaging experience.

There&#8217;s also an additional &#8220;tools&#8217; metagame element where you can save up\/purchase ninja tools for use in battle.  I found these to be mostly distractions compared to the actual moveset, but it does add a bit more variety to the already eclectic character set. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00017.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00017.jpg\" alt=\"2014-06-29_00017\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5286\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00017.jpg 1920w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00017-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00017-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/2014-06-29_00017-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Are cutscenes and kaiju fights enough?

And so I did.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/IMG_20140718_210732.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/IMG_20140718_210732.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20140718_210732\" width=\"1148\" height=\"861\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5309\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/IMG_20140718_210732.jpg 1148w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/IMG_20140718_210732-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/IMG_20140718_210732-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1148px) 100vw, 1148px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Step 1: Download a walkthrough video.<br \/>\nThis step is easy.  Simply download one of the thousands of game walkthrough videos which are making the rounds on the internet.  I found a good one for &#8220;Zelda II&#8221; on NES.<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: Calculate Filesize<br \/>\nI&#8217;ve got 512mb free (478mb in the &#8220;real world&#8221; of manufacturers calculations), and the images I generate are about 50k apiece.  Conservatively, that&#8217;s about 10,000 images, or one per second for 2.7 hours.  <\/p>\n<p>Step 3: Convert to images<br \/>\nThere are many tools to convert video to images.  FFmpeg makes it a trivial task, and even Windows users can find a tool or too (just be sure not to install any &#8216;bundled&#8217; software, and always ALWAYS click &#8220;advanced&#8221; or &#8220;custom&#8221; install.  That&#8217;s where they get ya, those &#8216;automatic&#8217; installs.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4: Find a cool spot to put your game frame<br \/>\nBonus points if you can convince someone it&#8217;s a slow framerate live stream.<\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/IMG_20140718_210732.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sat, 19 Jul 2014 04:13:38 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 19 Jul 2014 04:13:38 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 19 Jul 2014 04:13:38 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":5313,"title":"10-Second Hacks: Paint A Rotating Fan","slug":"10-second-hacks-paint-a-rotating-fan","markdown":"\nHere\u2019s a quick one:\n\nHave a rotating fan?

Contrast this to the last game I reviewed (Shovel Knight), where I absolutely couldn\u2019t wait to play again, and had to force myself to stop after long sessions.

There\u2019s also 2 contact pads on the top of the unit for charging the controllers (if your hands are large enough to use them.) Best of all, there\u2019s a power switch that when held in for a couple seconds will cut all power to the unit.\n\nWhat most don\u2019t know however, is that there is nothing special about the GameStick that makes it work with the dock. It\u2019s simply a powered USB hub with a number of useful additions. The power switch doesn\u2019t interact with the GameStick directly, it just cuts power to the entire unit. This is great, as most android stick computers don\u2019t come with a power switch. This is extremely frustrating for those of us trying to cut down on power consumption, as they\u2019ll just sit in a low power state sucking energy unless you physically unplug them.\n\nAt any rate, here\u2019s how you can upgrade your GameStick dock to work with any phone or stick pc. I\u2019ll be using my trusty old iMito MX1 stick PC, but this will also work with any phone or tablet that supports usb host (damn near all of them.)\n\nGrab a screwdriver, and unscrew the 2 screws which are under the foot-pads of the expanding part of the dock.\n\n[![20140822_082609](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/20140822_082609.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/20140822_082609.jpg)\n\nNow that those 2 screws are out, you can pull the expanding part of the dock wide open. You\u2019ll see that the micro-USB assembly is held on by another 2 screws. Remove them.\n\n[![20140822_094123](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/20140822_094123.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/20140822_094123.jpg)\n\nAt this point, you can pull the micro-usb assembly (which is connected by a flexible wire) back towards the main unit.

There&#8217;s also 2 contact pads on the top of the unit for charging the controllers (if your hands are large enough to use them.)  Best of all, there&#8217;s a power switch that when held in for a couple seconds will cut all power to the unit.<\/p>\n<p>What most don&#8217;t know however, is that there is nothing special about the GameStick that makes it work with the dock.  It&#8217;s simply a powered USB hub with a number of useful additions.  The power switch doesn&#8217;t interact with the GameStick directly, it just cuts power to the entire unit.  This is great, as most android stick computers don&#8217;t come with a power switch.  This is extremely frustrating for those of us trying to cut down on power consumption, as they&#8217;ll just sit in a low power state sucking energy unless you physically unplug them.<\/p>\n<p>At any rate, here&#8217;s how you can upgrade your GameStick dock to work with any phone or stick pc.  I&#8217;ll be using my trusty old iMito MX1 stick PC, but this will also work with any phone or tablet that supports usb host (damn near all of them.)<\/p>\n<p>Grab a screwdriver, and unscrew the 2 screws which are under the foot-pads of the expanding part of the dock.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/20140822_082609.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/20140822_082609.jpg\" alt=\"20140822_082609\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5347\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/20140822_082609.jpg 3264w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/20140822_082609-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/20140822_082609-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now that those 2 screws are out, you can pull the expanding part of the dock wide open.

A slightly flawed game that shines with excellence. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Rdr_manzanita_post00.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Rdr_manzanita_post00.jpg\" alt=\"Rdr_manzanita_post00\" width=\"1280\" height=\"718\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5367\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Rdr_manzanita_post00.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Rdr_manzanita_post00-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Rdr_manzanita_post00-1024x574.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot to like about RDR, and if you can get past the bland graphics you&#8217;ll find a compelling and well written story with a fun cast of interesting characters.<br \/>\nNote, all images in this article are copyrighted marketing material from Rockstar.

My trusty GBA had served me well since launch. Many a long lunch hour had been spent playing super mario advance at work (don\u2019t feel too bad for my long distant employer, I was an intern in the advertising\/tobacco industry.) I read an article about an upcoming Castlevania game, Aria of Sorrow. \u201cMan, they\u2019re putting out a lot of Castlevania games\u201d I thought to myself, and continued reading whatever corporate trash gaming PR mag they had in my small town.\n\n[![Castlevania Aria of Sorrow (U)_02](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_02.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_02.png)\n\nNow flash forward to 2003. Aria of Sorrow is out, reviews are stellar. \u201cCould it be better than Symphony of the Night?\u201d For me, it was.\n\n[![Castlevania Aria of Sorrow (U)_08](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_08.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_08.png)\n\nAria of Sorrow is very similar to Symphony. You explore a castle, you become more powerful and level up in an RPG fashion. You buy clothes, items, and weapons while you explore a sprawling castle. However, ever since Symphony had been released in 1997, Castlevania games had a bit of an inferiority complex. Symphony was a big critical hit on the PS1, and a sales giant. It completely changed what people thought of Castlevania games. As a result, every Castlevania game to come out since Symphony has had a single twist in gameplay.\n\n[![Castlevania Aria of Sorrow (U)_09](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_09.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_09.png)\n\nYes, a single twist. One. For over a decade every Castlevania game that was released was Symphony of the Night + one mechanic. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I do love Symphony. And the mechanics were mostly fun. However by the the Aria rolled around, I was feeling a bit jaded.\n\n[![Castlevania Aria of Sorrow (U)_11](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_11.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_11.png)\n\nThat feeling passed. Aria of Sorrow was set in the future, with a cool anime aesthetic and a single gameplay twist. You played as a man who may become the next Dracula, and you absorb the souls of the enemies you fight. You can then summon them later, and use their abilities in a host of ways. This brilliant pokemon-esque twist completely upped the Castlevania bar.\n\n[![Castlevania Aria of Sorrow (U)_12](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_12.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_12.png)\n\nYou see, as the future Dracula you can absorb the soul of every enemy in the game. This effectively means you get to use their powers as your magic attacks There are many dozens of souls to absorb, and these attacks range from \u201cmeh\u201d to \u201choly crap he just changed into a demon and raced across 5 screens causing CHAOS!\u201d and everything in between. Time stop. Familiars. Bat wings. Super strength. It\u2019s great fun, and it keeps the gameplay engaging and fresh through each playthrough.\n\n[![Castlevania Aria of Sorrow (U)_14](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_14.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_14.png)\n\nHow is this accomplished? Each of the monsters may randomly drop their soul, and often they don\u2019t. So, if you\u2019re not trying to grind souls (to get the very very best ending which is essentially just the good ending with a happier tone), you\u2019re going to get a different set of souls through each playthrough. This means your gameplay style may be completely different each time you play through this roughly seven hour game.\n\nOne of the qualities that I most enjoy about a properly done exploration mechanic is \u201cdepth when you want it.\u201d That is to say, it\u2019s not required that you explore every nook and cranny of the castle to get a good ending (the best ending perhaps, but not a good ending.) You can still fight all the bosses, collect souls, get a good ending, and have a great time without meticulously exploring every secret area and obtaining every hidden soul or item. That said, if you\u2019re into that Aria of Sorrow has some really fun souls hidden behind small puzzles.\n\n[![Castlevania Aria of Sorrow (U)_15](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_15.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_15.png)\n\nThe sound is classic 16\/32-bit Castlevania sound, nothing to complain about. The graphics are crisp and fun, filled with large character sprites and a myriad of super moves. This latest play through, I focused on flame weapons and swords. My next, I may have an imp that follows me around as I hide in the shadows, allowing him to distract the enemies while I throw soup at them. Yes, there\u2019s a bowl of soup throwing demon soul. That\u2019s good times.\n\n[![Castlevania Aria of Sorrow (U)_24](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_24.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_24.png)\n\nIn the end, even 11 years later I supremely enjoyed my latest playthrough of Aria of Sorrow. I rate it 93\/100, a true classic that stands the test of time.\n\n[![Castlevania Aria of Sorrow (U)_29](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_29.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_29.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_01.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Castlevania-Aria-of-Sorrow-U_01.png\" alt=\"Castlevania Aria of Sorrow (U)_01\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5376\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Flashback to 2002.

Background characters move and the above room in particular reminded me of Blackthorne for DOS, which came out many years later in the 1990s.

Once you\u2019ve mastered the controls (and the fine art of throwing a finite amount of rocks in a very strange fashion), things progress quickly. You can easily beat this game in one or two sittings. You will die, many many times, but you\u2019ll be stronger for it.\n\nYou\u2019ll not be rewarded with animated cut scenes, achievement points, magic powers, or a shout on your wall. Only the promise of a harder challenge ready for you if you\u2019re able, and a control scheme that I\u2019d rather seen left dead and buried in the annals of game history.\n\n[![controls](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/controls.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/controls.png)\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s not hard to recommend Dark Castle. Everyone should play it, purely for perspective. With the speed of processors stagnating, sometimes it\u2019s refreshing to know that a talented team can overcome the limits of what\u2019s accepted as possible and push beyond. I give Dark Castle a 65\/100, playable but dated and somewhat lacking in the ole fun department. It\u2019s a technological milestone that everyone should play, but not everyone will enjoy.\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/levelone.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/levelone.png\" alt=\"levelone\" width=\"1023\" height=\"675\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5390\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/levelone.png 1023w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/levelone-300x197.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Do you hate the comforts of modern platform gaming?

With the speed of processors stagnating, sometimes it&#8217;s refreshing to know that a talented team can overcome the limits of what&#8217;s accepted as possible and push beyond.  I give Dark Castle a 65\/100, playable but dated and somewhat lacking in the ole fun department. It&#8217;s a technological milestone that everyone should play, but not everyone will enjoy. <\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/title.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 21 Sep 2014 03:47:31 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 21 Sep 2014 03:47:31 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 21 Sep 2014 03:47:31 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":5396,"title":"Review: Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link","slug":"review-zelda-2-the-adventure-of-link","markdown":"\nWhen I was a child, Zelda 2 was very important to me. I was a very poor child of 7 with a very rich neighbor, and every so often he would invite me over to play. We never played video games, but his gold Zelda cartridge always caught my eye. I knew I had to have a NES, and a gold Zelda cartridge. Two years later (4 years after the NES was released) I finally saved enough money to buy one. I was 9 years old. It was the Mario\/Duck Hunt\/Track and Field bundle (which came with the power pad accessory.) It was another year before I saved enough money to buy Zelda on sale for 20$. I played it constantly.

This much it has in common with every other Zelda game. Certainly it wasn\u2019t quite as popular as the original blockbuster hit Zelda, perhaps due to it\u2019s difficulty level.\n\nLike most NES games of the day, it was hard. Really hard. In fact, Zelda 2 was so exceptionally hard I couldn\u2019t beat it in the 2 weekend days I had rented it. I managed to make it about halfway through.

Stuck in a cramped space with no internet and constant noise for 4-8 hours will drive you to some interesting distractions. That\u2019s not the whole story though, it really started over 20 years ago. I was in junior high school, and [Eye of the Beholder](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eye_of_the_Beholder_(video_game)) had just been released. As far as I was concerned, it changed everything. While I was a hardcore top-down [gold-box DnD](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gold_Box) gamer, Eye of the Beholder was so immersive and mind-blowing on my 486. Doom was still 2 years away, and here was a first person Dungeons and Dragons game, with combat in first-person! Previous games had only let you view the map in first-person. This made all the difference, at the time. And not just for me.\n\n[![Eye_of_the_Beholder_I_PC_box](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Eye_of_the_Beholder_I_PC_box.jpeg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Eye_of_the_Beholder_I_PC_box.jpeg)\n\nI was a nervous 7th grader in a new school. With no friends and a deep knowledge of computers, my prospects were slim. So I didn\u2019t blend in so well that year, or so I thought. One of the cool \u201cbad boy\u201d types had been paired up with me for a pair exercise in english class. We had some down time to talk, and he asked if I liked DnD. You see, Eye of the Beholder had taken root in more hearts than mine. Something about the first-person perspective coupled with gorgeous graphics had managed to break through the strict cultural barriers of the time. It was perhaps the first time I realized the difference between mainstream and nerd was starting to lessen.\n\n[![download (1)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/download-1.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/download-1.jpg)\n\nTwenty-two years later I picked up the GBA port on a whim. Not really to my surprise, it was a terrible port\u2026 if you can call it a port. It\u2019s been shortened and lessened in every way. There are glaring holes in the user interface. Much of it feels unfinished and cobbled together from prior games (games which were almost 2 decades old when this \u201cport\u201d was released.) And yet, somehow these flaws all work together to make the game more than the sum of it\u2019s shitty parts.\n\nFirst off, there\u2019s a finite number of enemies in the game. That means grinding levels (or moderately high level characters) are a no go. It also means you have to be clever and plan your battles carefully. This can make you desperate, but that desperation makes for a difficult and surprisingly engaging experience. There\u2019s little creativity in the levels, though there is a bit of meanness at play in the user interface. When I say meanness in relation to a game, I mean that the developer hasn\u2019t (or couldn\u2019t) taken the time to flesh out a feature so that it\u2019s obvious or intuitive to the user.\n\n[![images (2)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/images-2.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/images-2.jpg)\n\nCase in point, there\u2019s a set of abilities called \u2018feats\u2019 in the DnD game system. One of them is search. You would think that search lets you find hidden doors right? So you go along, using \u2018search.\u2019 And you don\u2019t find anything. Odd right? At this point those who have recently played one of the older gold box games (think, Pools of Radiance) are probably laughing their collective asses off, because in the original gold box games you had to physically walk into a wall to find a hidden door. This game is no different. While the search command may occasionally say \u2018you feel a draft\u2019 to indicate a hidden door is near, you have to actually walk into the wall to find it. This means you must spent time scrutinizing each map looking for potential hidden doors, then go walk into the walls surrounding that space and hope for the best. There\u2019s no upside on that one, it was a clunky user interface that was improved in later titles.\n\n[![_-Advanced-Dungeons-and-Dragons-Eye-of-the-Beholder-GBA-_](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Advanced-Dungeons-and-Dragons-Eye-of-the-Beholder-GBA-_.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Advanced-Dungeons-and-Dragons-Eye-of-the-Beholder-GBA-_.jpg)\n\nThere\u2019s also no first-person fighting.

The interaction with other characters is almost non-existent, save for a couple of planned interactions and monster parley (another feature of the gold-box games that threw me way back.) On the other hand there\u2019s a surprisingly deep construction of the DnD ruleset at play here. You fully generate your party, fight monsters, etc just as you would in a gold box game. In fact, I am starting to believe that EOTB is actually a gold box toolkit game. Honestly, if it weren\u2019t for a few user interface problems I\u2019d think it was a module from the [Unlimited Adventures](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Forgotten_Realms:_Unlimited_Adventures) creation kit, ported to run on the GBA. That\u2019s not such a bad thing though, if you loved the gold box games.\n\nThe length of the game is also quite lacking for an RPG of this type. While the gold box games of the 1980s could be many dozens of hours long, EOTB is only 18 levels. You can complete it on 3 or 4 domestic plane trips (believe me.) This doesn\u2019t bother me so much, as you\u2019ll be more apt to re-play the game with different character sets if it\u2019s shorter. Sadly, the entire game takes place in a single dungeon, and you\u2019ll probably not want to revisit it that often.\n\n[![hqdefault](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/hqdefault.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/hqdefault.jpg)\n\nComing back to the user interface, there are some real oversights.

That\u2019s right, if you haven\u2019t memorized the stat tables in advance from playing actual DnD the relative strength if items will be a complete mystery to you. The map system doesn\u2019t tell you which way your party is facing, making it a frustrating affair of trial-and-error every time you wish to get your bearings.

The way you actually have him raise your characters is so convoluted I actually couldn\u2019t figure it out on my plane ride.

Let\u2019s not forget this GBA game came out in 2002! That\u2019s 4 years after half-life. On the other hand, for some reason this greatly reminded me of some in-person DnD games I\u2019ve had over the years. That feeling of ridiculous, malicious frustration from a game is rare.

And yet somehow, I can\u2019t bring myself to dislike EOTBGBA (sounds like a[ boy band](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NKOTBSB).) There\u2019s enough of the gold box pedigree to be enjoyable for me, the die hard classic RPG fan. Sadly, that\u2019s a very small percentage of my readers, or the gaming public. Given the glaring omissions, I can only assume this game was a rush job. I give it a 43\/100 general score, but a 65\/100 for die-hard fans.

Stuck in a cramped space with no internet and constant noise for 4-8 hours will drive you to some interesting distractions.  That&#8217;s not the whole story though, it really started over 20 years ago.  I was in junior high school, and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eye_of_the_Beholder_(video_game)\">Eye of the Beholder<\/a> had just been released.  As far as I was concerned, it changed everything.  While I was a hardcore top-down <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gold_Box\">gold-box DnD<\/a> gamer, Eye of the Beholder was so immersive and mind-blowing on my 486.  Doom was still 2 years away, and here was a first person Dungeons and Dragons game, with combat in first-person!  Previous games had only let you view the map in first-person. This made all the difference, at the time.  And not just for me.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Eye_of_the_Beholder_I_PC_box.jpeg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Eye_of_the_Beholder_I_PC_box.jpeg\" alt=\"Eye_of_the_Beholder_I_PC_box\" width=\"327\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5433\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Eye_of_the_Beholder_I_PC_box.jpeg 327w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Eye_of_the_Beholder_I_PC_box-196x300.jpeg 196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I was a nervous 7th grader in a new school.  With no friends and a deep knowledge of computers, my prospects were slim.  So I didn&#8217;t blend in so well that year, or so I thought. One of the cool &#8220;bad boy&#8221; types had been paired up with me for a pair exercise in english class.  We had some down time to talk, and he asked if I liked DnD.  You see, Eye of the Beholder had taken root in more hearts than mine.  Something about the first-person perspective coupled with gorgeous graphics had managed to break through the strict cultural barriers of the time.  It was perhaps the first time I realized the difference between mainstream and nerd was starting to lessen.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/download-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/download-1.jpg\" alt=\"download (1)\" width=\"225\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5430\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/download-1.jpg 225w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/download-1-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/download-1-50x50.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Twenty-two years later I picked up the GBA port on a whim.  Not really to my surprise, it was a terrible port&#8230; if you can call it a port.  It&#8217;s been shortened and lessened in every way.  There are glaring holes in the user interface.  Much of it feels unfinished and cobbled together from prior games (games which were almost 2 decades old when this &#8220;port&#8221; was released.)  And yet, somehow these flaws all work together to make the game more than the sum of it&#8217;s shitty parts.<\/p>\n<p>First off, there&#8217;s a finite number of enemies in the game.  That means grinding levels (or moderately high level characters) are a no go.  It also means you have to be clever and plan your battles carefully.  This can make you desperate, but that desperation makes for a difficult and surprisingly engaging experience. There&#8217;s little creativity in the levels, though there is a bit of meanness at play in the user interface.  When I say meanness in relation to a game, I mean that the developer hasn&#8217;t (or couldn&#8217;t) taken the time to flesh out a feature so that it&#8217;s obvious or intuitive to the user.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/images-2.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/images-2.jpg\" alt=\"images (2)\" width=\"249\" height=\"165\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5428\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Case in point, there&#8217;s a set of abilities called &#8216;feats&#8217; in the DnD game system.

At this point those who have recently played one of the older gold box games (think, Pools of Radiance) are probably laughing their collective asses off, because in the original gold box games you had to physically walk into a wall to find a hidden door.  This game is no different.  While the search command may occasionally say &#8216;you feel a draft&#8217; to indicate a hidden door is near, you have to actually walk into the wall to find it.

In the brief period before I was banned from the PSN network I would download game demos. When the demo for the thirteenth installment in the Final Fantasy franchise dropped 5ish years ago, I downloaded the multi-gig demo right away. Ok, so it was more like the 25th Final Fantasy game, but it was the 13th official integer numbered installment.\n\n[![2014-10-31_00020](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00020.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00020.jpg)\n\nI didn\u2019t care for it. Now it\u2019s out on Steam and I put 53 hours into it over the course of many weeks before I saw the credits roll. What changed in the past 5 years? Have I changed, has the gaming landscape changed? Was FF13 5 years ahead of its time?\n\n[![2014-10-11_00002](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00002.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00002.jpg)\n\nSomehow I doubt it. Rather, 5 years ago I was working at a start-up and didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a good Final Fantasy game. And that\u2019s really what Final Fantasy 1e is, an investment. You invest a great deal of your time for an experience and a story that\u2019s uniquely Final Fantasy.\n\n[![2014-10-20_00004](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-20_00004.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-20_00004.jpg)\n\nFinal Fantasy 13 is, if anything, unique. It features an epic sci-fi\/fantasy storyline and a rich RPG system that cherry-picks elements from past games in the series. The ATB battle system from 4 is back (my favorite in the series), as is the AI controlled secondary characters from 12. Chocobos make an appearance (and require an oddly paced series of side-quests I\u2019ll touch on later.) City and character names are often drawn from the classic Final Fantasy pool (porumpolum from 4, cid from every game ever, all of the summons from 4 forward.)\n\n[![2014-10-20_00001](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-20_00001.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-20_00001.jpg)\n\nThe thing is, you have to really work for things in 13. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a hard game (most of the time), but you have to put in a great deal of time before you gain access to features you had from hour 1 in previous games. I\u2019m talking about the ability to pick who is in your party, riding a chocobo, casting a summon, deviate even 1 screen from the mostly linear gameplay map, etc. These are basic elements of most RPGs. Not to mention there\u2019s no overworld. Why did the creators of 13 choose to spread out the features over many hours of gameplay?\n\n[![2014-10-11_00047](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00047.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00047.jpg)\n\nI have a theory. Most players don\u2019t make it to the end of a sprawling RPG. Perhaps by metering out the gameplay features more slowly, the designers hoped keep the players engaged further along in the storyline. That\u2019s just a theory. Did it work? I don\u2019t think so. One of the more common complaints upon the game\u2019s release was that it was a game set to automatic. I have to admit, the first hour to two of the game you can essentially just hold up and press b over and over until each battle is over.\n\n[![2014-10-11_00045](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00045.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00045.jpg)\n\nIt\u2019s another 18 or so hours after that until you can pick which characters go into your party. What kept me entranced for so long?\n\n[![2014-10-11_00043](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00043.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00043.jpg)\n\nGraphics played a large part. The character models are fully realized but not so realistic as to be creepy. The environments are huge (though almost always a completely linear path.) The bosses are huge too, and the enemy character models are colorful and diverse. It\u2019s everything you want to see in an RPG.\n\n[![2014-10-11_00028](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00028.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00028.jpg)\n\nThe plot is also an off the wall mix of Final Fantasy magic lore and modern sci-fi tropes. Magically infused demi-gods rule over a complacent population, held high aloft over the wild world below. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of years of history, lore, human suffering, and technological stagnation are presented over the course of the game. It\u2019s a fully fleshed out world with a great premise.\n\n[![2014-10-11_00023](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00023.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00023.jpg)\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s all roses in the writing department. Like most Japanese RPGS, the writing can go from dramatic to incredibly cheese in a matter of moments. This can give rise to some truly cringe-worthy exchanges between the characters. One character in particular will grate on your nerves for the first twenty or so hours of story.\n\n[![2014-10-11_00013](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00013.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00013.jpg)\n\nSomehow though, it all blends together to make for an enjoyable experience. I found myself wrapped up with a game like I hadn\u2019t been since high school. 53 hours is an incredible amount of time to spend on anything anymore. Not since dragon quest 8 on the PS2 had I found myself putting so much time into one experience.\n\n[![2014-10-11_00004](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00004.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00004.jpg)\n\nThat\u2019s what Final Fantasy is though, an experience. I still very much recall the details of Final Fantasy 7 because I spent 60 or 70 hours playing it. The fact that this was when I was in high school nearly 20 years ago doesn\u2019t dull the memory. It\u2019s a unique page in my gaming scrap book. That\u2019s how I feel about 13.\n\n[![2014-10-21_00004](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-21_00004.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-21_00004.jpg)\n\nAny review of 13 would be remiss in not discussing the incredibly strange pacing of the later chapters. After 10 straight chapters of gameplay, you find yourself 25 hours in and out into the wild. Ever single side-quest is in this chapter, and they are all numbered. For that matter, they are all the same quest: Kill this specific monster that\u2019s far away from your current location.\n\n[![2014-10-27_00007](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00007.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00007.jpg)\n\nWho then, in their right mind would go on 30 or 40 hours worth of monster killing smack dab at the end of a 30 hour game?\n\n[![2014-10-31_00003](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00003.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00003.jpg)\n\nAnd here is the irony of the whole thing. These side-quests in chapter 11, once you have completed the first 14 you unlock everyone\u2019s favorite bird, the chocobo. These allow you to fast travel. This is a sad irony, as by this point you\u2019ve criss-crossed and back-tracked so far and so often you\u2019ll have no trouble completing the last 2 chapters of the game. If you do this, you\u2019re putting yourself through the grinder just to unlock birds that allow you to fast travel. Sadly, they only allow you to fast travel within the plains area of chapter 11.\n\n[![2014-10-27_00010](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00010.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00010.jpg)\n\nReally, you can almost think of chapter 11 as a wholly different game. Where the first 30 hours of the game has been Final Fantasy, every single side-quest is Monster Hunter. Way to go Capcom, you\u2019ve managed to make so much money Squaresoft is incorporating your game mechanics into Final Fantasy.\n\n[![2014-10-31_00025](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00025.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00025.jpg)\n\nAnd let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s a lot of money at play here. Final Fantasy is a huge franchise, and the CG alone in 13 cost many millions of dollars to produce. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn it cost more than their failed \u201cSpirits Within\u2019 movie (which cost me an internship when the studio closed all those years ago.) So appealing to the broadest audience possible while somehow keeping true to the semi-hardcore Final Fantasy RPG roots is the tightrope this game had to walk.\n\n[![2014-10-31_00037](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00037.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00037.jpg)\n\nSure, the first few hours are a button-mashing lawl through the beginner\u2019s section of RPG-lite town. Sure, the pacing is strange and the characters are at times so badly written as to be off putting. Hell, they pull some wild deus ex machina\u2019s out of their collective dungeon master\u2019s guide more than once. It wouldn\u2019t be a Final Fantasy game if they didn\u2019t. And it\u2019s long, so long that there are flashback scenes to other flashback scenes that happened dozens of hours before. It\u2019s meta, and it\u2019s cheesy, and it fits right in with the greats in the series.\n\n[![2014-10-31_00055](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00055.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00055.jpg)\n\nIn the end, that\u2019s exactly that FF13 is to me: The epitome of the Final Fantasy experience, good and bad. If you love Final Fantasy and you have some time to kill, it\u2019s the best possible time-waster you can run on your shiny new Surface Pro or Macbook. Even if you\u2019re playing on the PS3 or 360, you\u2019re going to have a good time. Just be prepared for the long haul. I rate FF13 a solid 81\/100. It stands as a great entry in the Final Fantasy series, but if you\u2019re coming in fresh there are going to be some serious quirks you\u2019ll have to get used to.\n\n[![2014-10-31_00057](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00057.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00057.jpg)\n\n\n","html":"<p>I remember the demo.

It features an epic sci-fi\/fantasy storyline and a rich RPG system that cherry-picks elements from past games in the series.  The ATB battle system from 4 is back (my favorite in the series), as is the AI controlled secondary characters from 12.  Chocobos make an appearance (and require an oddly paced series of side-quests I&#8217;ll touch on later.)  City and character names are often drawn from the classic Final Fantasy pool (porumpolum from 4, cid from every game ever, all of the summons from 4 forward.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-20_00001.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-20_00001.jpg\" alt=\"2014-10-20_00001\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5450\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-20_00001.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-20_00001-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-20_00001-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-20_00001-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The thing is, you have to really work for things in 13. That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s a hard game (most of the time), but you have to put in a great deal of time before you gain access to features you had from hour 1 in previous games. I&#8217;m talking about the ability to pick who is in your party, riding a chocobo, casting a summon, deviate even 1 screen from the mostly linear gameplay map, etc.  These are basic elements of most RPGs.  Not to mention there&#8217;s no overworld.  Why did the creators of 13 choose to spread out the features over many hours of gameplay? <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00047.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00047.jpg\" alt=\"2014-10-11_00047\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5449\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00047.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00047-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00047-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00047-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I have a theory.  Most players don&#8217;t make it to the end of a sprawling RPG.  Perhaps by metering out the gameplay features more slowly, the designers hoped keep the players engaged further along in the storyline.  That&#8217;s just a theory.  Did it work?  I don&#8217;t think so.  One of the more common complaints upon the game&#8217;s release was that it was a game set to automatic.  I have to admit, the first hour to two of the game you can essentially just hold up and press b over and over until each battle is over. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00045.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00045.jpg\" alt=\"2014-10-11_00045\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5448\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00045.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00045-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00045-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-11_00045-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s another 18 or so hours after that until you can pick which characters go into your party.

For that matter, they are all the same quest: Kill this specific monster that&#8217;s far away from your current location.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00007.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00007.jpg\" alt=\"2014-10-27_00007\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5453\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00007.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00007-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00007-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00007-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Who then, in their right mind would go on 30 or 40 hours worth of monster killing smack dab at the end of a 30 hour game? <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00003.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00003.jpg\" alt=\"2014-10-31_00003\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5455\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00003.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00003-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00003-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00003-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And here is the irony of the whole thing.  These side-quests in chapter 11, once you have completed the first 14 you unlock everyone&#8217;s favorite bird, the chocobo.  These allow you to fast travel.  This is a sad irony, as by this point you&#8217;ve criss-crossed and back-tracked so far and so often you&#8217;ll have no trouble completing the last 2 chapters of the game.  If you do this, you&#8217;re putting yourself through the grinder just to unlock birds that allow you to fast travel.  Sadly, they only allow you to fast travel within the plains area of chapter 11.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00010.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00010.jpg\" alt=\"2014-10-27_00010\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5454\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00010.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00010-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00010-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-27_00010-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Really, you can almost think of chapter 11 as a wholly different game.  Where the first 30 hours of the game has been Final Fantasy, every single side-quest is Monster Hunter.  Way to go Capcom, you&#8217;ve managed to make so much money Squaresoft is incorporating your game mechanics into Final Fantasy. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00025.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00025.jpg\" alt=\"2014-10-31_00025\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5457\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00025.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00025-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00025-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00025-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And let&#8217;s face it, there&#8217;s a lot of money at play here.  Final Fantasy is a huge franchise, and the CG alone in 13 cost many millions of dollars to produce.  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to learn it cost more than their failed &#8220;Spirits Within&#8217; movie (which cost me an internship when the studio closed all those years ago.)  So appealing to the broadest audience possible while somehow keeping true to the semi-hardcore Final Fantasy RPG roots is the tightrope this game had to walk.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00037.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00037.jpg\" alt=\"2014-10-31_00037\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5458\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00037.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00037-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00037-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00037-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Sure, the first few hours are a button-mashing lawl through the beginner&#8217;s section of RPG-lite town.  Sure, the pacing is strange and the characters are at times so badly written as to be off putting. Hell, they pull some wild deus ex machina&#8217;s out of their collective dungeon master&#8217;s guide more than once. It wouldn&#8217;t be a Final Fantasy game if they didn&#8217;t.  And it&#8217;s long, so long that there are flashback scenes to other flashback scenes that happened dozens of hours before.  It&#8217;s meta, and it&#8217;s cheesy, and it fits right in with the greats in the series.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00055.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00055.jpg\" alt=\"2014-10-31_00055\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5459\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00055.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00055-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00055-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00055-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the end, that&#8217;s exactly that FF13 is to me: The epitome of the Final Fantasy experience, good and bad.  If you love Final Fantasy and you have some time to kill, it&#8217;s the best possible time-waster you can run on your shiny new Surface Pro or Macbook.  Even if you&#8217;re playing on the PS3 or 360, you&#8217;re going to have a good time.  Just be prepared for the long haul.  I rate FF13 a solid 81\/100.  It stands as a great entry in the Final Fantasy series, but if you&#8217;re coming in fresh there are going to be some serious quirks  you&#8217;ll have to get used to. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00057.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00057.jpg\" alt=\"2014-10-31_00057\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5460\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00057.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00057-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00057-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00057-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-10-31_00020.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sat, 01 Nov 2014 05:41:37 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 01 Nov 2014 05:41:37 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 01 Nov 2014 05:41:37 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":5468,"title":"Review: Steamworld Dig","slug":"review-steamworld-dig","markdown":"\nWishing you had a game to play that filled you with moments of joy?

Metroid takes this formula as THE formula for making a game. No deviation from the theme is necessary.

This mechanic (reminiscent of Dig-Dig) is so enjoyable as to be mesmerizing at times. Upgrade your weapons to dig through harder materials to reach new depths and more difficult enemies (and fabulous prizes!) Anyone who\u2019s spent a great deal of time playing Minecraft or Terraria will know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n[![2014-11-06_00003](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-11-06_00003.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-11-06_00003.jpg)\n\nThe graphics are crisp and spot-on. I played it on Steam, though the 3ds version looks just as great in person. The sound effects are minimal and well played, while the score is understated but well put together. Nothing to complain about, and with the steampunk\/cartoon\/retro-esque vibe it\u2019ll look and sound just as fresh in 10 year\n\n[![2014-11-06_00008](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-11-06_00008.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2014-11-06_00008.jpg)\n\nIn the end, I just couldn\u2019t stop playing Steamworld Dig. It reminded me very much of my experience watching \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy.\u201d Absolute joy in the world I had been immersed in, sadness that it was over, but satisfaction that it was never too long or boring. A polished hit from start to finish than anyone can enjoy. I rate Steamworld Dig a 92\/100, an instant classic.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Wishing you had a game to play that filled you with moments of joy?

In 2007 when Mario Galaxy was released, I rushed right out and bought it. I then spent 5 vacation days and two straight weeks worth of long evenings completing the game and unlocking all the extra stars. After it was over I was emotionally exhausted, and eventually moved on to the other big releases of 07. A few years later in 2010 Mario Galaxy 2 is released. I manage to wait until February 2011 to pick it up. And that\u2019s the date on the save file I\u2019m reviewing, 2\/3\/2011.\n\n[![QdYW_3i2wdrZx3Ru_sRqIAwu9e2XHXgE-noscale](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/QdYW_3i2wdrZx3Ru_sRqIAwu9e2XHXgE-noscale.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/QdYW_3i2wdrZx3Ru_sRqIAwu9e2XHXgE-noscale.jpg)\n\nFor the first year I played about a level a week. I was working at a start-up, and things were stressful to say the least. Another year went by, and I continued to play about a level a week. Every six months or so I\u2019d go on a big Galaxy kick and play a level a night for a week or so. This continued past the launch of the Wii U. Hesitant to attempt a system transfer on my modded Wii (I\u2019ve been banned from psn for many, many years) I kept my original Wii on my smaller secondary TV. Just for Galaxy 2. Just for this save file.\n\n[![iCMtBD-C5H06NBxG9vL_WFCD-EBY9n46-noscale](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/iCMtBD-C5H06NBxG9vL_WFCD-EBY9n46-noscale.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/iCMtBD-C5H06NBxG9vL_WFCD-EBY9n46-noscale.jpg)\n\nAnd that says something about a game, doesn\u2019t it? If Mario Galaxy was the introduction to \u201cMario in Space!\u201d then Mario Galaxy 2 is the refinement of the concept to it\u2019s most pure. You get a set of 80 or so levels, and you\u2019ll need to go through these levels in various ways about 5 to 6 times each. If you\u2019re playing a level or two a week, well you can see how it took me three and a half years to post this review. I give Mario Galaxy 2 an 93\/100. It\u2019s good enough to keep you coming back for at least three years. That\u2019s quite a return on investment.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Three and a half years.

Just for this save file.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/iCMtBD-C5H06NBxG9vL_WFCD-EBY9n46-noscale.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/iCMtBD-C5H06NBxG9vL_WFCD-EBY9n46-noscale.jpg\" alt=\"iCMtBD-C5H06NBxG9vL_WFCD-EBY9n46-noscale\" width=\"522\" height=\"293\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5494\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/iCMtBD-C5H06NBxG9vL_WFCD-EBY9n46-noscale.jpg 522w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/iCMtBD-C5H06NBxG9vL_WFCD-EBY9n46-noscale-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And that says something about a game, doesn&#8217;t it?  If Mario Galaxy was the introduction to &#8220;Mario in Space!&#8221; then Mario Galaxy 2 is the refinement of the concept to it&#8217;s most pure.  You get a set of 80 or so levels, and you&#8217;ll need to go through these levels in various ways about 5 to 6 times each.  If you&#8217;re playing a level or two a week, well you can see how it took me three and a half years to post this review.  I give Mario Galaxy 2 an 93\/100.  It&#8217;s good enough to keep you coming back for at least three years.  That&#8217;s quite a return on investment.<\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Super-mario-galaxy-2-wii.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 01:44:47 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 01:44:47 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 01:44:47 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":5498,"title":"Review: Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse","slug":"review-castle-of-illusion-starring-mickey-mouse","markdown":"\nI\u2019ll admit it, I\u2019m a sucker for game remakes.

This is real creative freedom that I support. All of my apps and games are open source. A while back, I helped fund the [opening ](http:\/\/open.commonly.cc\/)of some game music and art assets to the public. Being in the public domain (or having a Creative Commons license as these art assets now do) allows for public remixing and free use of the content. Gotta love that.\n\nFast forward to this week. I was relaxing on a short stay-cation, playing games and watching TV, and I began to think to myself: \u201cWhy not remix one of my games with some of this new creative commons content?\u201d So that\u2019s what I set out to do. You can grab the latest source code from the GitHub page [here](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/cantstoptherock). Here\u2019s how it\u2019s looking right now: (**Note any ghosting or slowdown you see is an artifact from screen capture)\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"525\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/6Uj_0MR8Ty8?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\"><\/iframe>\n\nI started by copying the base of my last game, [Pop Them Balloons](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/PopThemBalloons). The source is heavily commented, and uses my high-level abstraction libraries to make basic game design a very straightforward task. Title\/Credits screens are one-liners in code. This allows me to concentrate on the base gameplay mechanics and refine the core experience without worrying about scrolling end credits text or background music etc.\n\nThe concept for my new game \u201cCan\u2019t Stop The Rock\u201d is quite simple. It\u2019s a casual game flipped on it\u2019s head. You play \u201cthe level\u201d, dropping balloons that quickly scroll left towards \u201cthe rock.\u201d. The rock rolls around the screen dispatching your balloons. I\u2019ll add weapon upgrades and various mechanics from my previous action games for the rock to execute while you drop balloons. The \u201cgoal\u201d, if there is one, is to get balloons past the rock. I want the game to be so fast and slick, 60+fps at all times. And I\u2019m going to do it without resorting to native code or OpenGL.\n\n[![device-2014-11-26-102558](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/device-2014-11-26-102558.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/device-2014-11-26-102558.png)\n\nI kept the balloon abstraction from \u201cPop Them Balloons,\u201d as well as the difficulty selection screen and the basic game panel structure. Balloons now update to float right to left instead of bottom to top. I also updated the base project to use Gradle as the compilation system.\n\nThe rock started out as a simple green circle for prototyping. He slowly moved towards the balloons and didn\u2019t do much else. While I knew it was time to design a better AI system for our little hero, I took some time to start removing the \u2018Pop Them Balloons\u2019 branding and music.\n\nI used a slick gradient in [Pinta ](http:\/\/pinta-project.com\/) to create the icons, title screen, and speed settings buttons. Things were already starting to seem like a very different game.\n\nFirst, it was time to upgrade the audio. Pop Them Balloons had three main songs, a title theme, a credits theme, and a game theme. I\u2019m going to upgrade that to five songs for Can\u2019t Stop: a title theme, a credits theme, and three game themes. I updated the code to change the game theme depending on the difficulty selected, that way you can have a more casual experience on more casual game modes.\n\nAnd here I ran into my first creative editing situation. I felt the \u2018game over\u2019 theme from HalyconFalconX would make for a great title them on Can\u2019t Stop The Rock\u2026 Except for the inclusion of \u201cFail!\u201d at the end of the song. Not to worry, I opened up Audacity (my favorite open source MP3 editor) and clipped it out of the waveform. That\u2019s the sort of thing you can do with open content.\n\n[![audacity](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/audacity.png)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/audacity.png)\n\nI wanted the action to be fast and furious, so I went with high BPM tracks and removed some graphical flourishes for now.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"525\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/dBl-0xNH544?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\"><\/iframe>\n\nFrom here I updated the background to pulsate through a known list of pleasant colors, and updated the little rock hero to actually pop some balloons as it crossed them.

This is real creative freedom that I support.  All of my apps and games are open source.  A while back, I helped fund the <a href=\"http:\/\/open.commonly.cc\/\">opening <\/a>of some game music and art assets to the public.  Being in the public domain (or having a Creative Commons license as these art assets now do) allows for public remixing and free use of the content.  Gotta love that.  <\/p>\n<p>Fast forward to this week.  I was relaxing on a short stay-cation, playing games and watching TV, and I began to think to myself: &#8220;Why not remix one of my games with some of this new creative commons content?&#8221;  So that&#8217;s what I set out to do.  You can grab the latest source code from the GitHub page <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/cantstoptherock\">here<\/a>.  Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s looking right now:  (**Note any ghosting or slowdown you see is an artifact from screen capture)<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"700\" height=\"525\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/6Uj_0MR8Ty8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>I started by copying the base of my last game, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/PopThemBalloons\">Pop Them Balloons<\/a>.  The source is heavily commented, and uses my high-level abstraction libraries to make basic game design a very straightforward task.  Title\/Credits screens are one-liners in code.  This allows me to concentrate on the base gameplay mechanics and refine the core experience without worrying about scrolling end credits text or background music etc.  <\/p>\n<p>The concept for my new game &#8220;Can&#8217;t Stop The Rock&#8221; is quite simple.  It&#8217;s a casual game flipped on it&#8217;s head.  You play &#8220;the level&#8221;, dropping balloons that quickly scroll left towards &#8220;the rock.&#8221;.  The rock rolls around the screen dispatching your balloons.  I&#8217;ll add weapon upgrades and various mechanics from my previous action games for the rock to execute while you drop balloons.  The &#8220;goal&#8221;, if there is one, is to get balloons past the rock.  I want the game to be so fast and slick, 60+fps at all times.  And I&#8217;m going to do it without resorting to native code or OpenGL. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/device-2014-11-26-102558.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/device-2014-11-26-102558.png\" alt=\"device-2014-11-26-102558\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5511\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I kept the balloon abstraction from &#8220;Pop Them Balloons,&#8221; as well as the difficulty selection screen and the basic game panel structure. Balloons now update to float right to left instead of bottom to top.  I also updated the base project to use Gradle as the compilation system. <\/p>\n<p>The rock started out as a simple green circle for prototyping.  He slowly moved towards the balloons and didn&#8217;t do much else.  While I knew it was time to design a better AI system for our little hero, I took some time to start removing the &#8216;Pop Them Balloons&#8217; branding and music.<\/p>\n<p>I used a slick gradient in <a href=\"http:\/\/pinta-project.com\/\">Pinta <\/a> to create the icons, title screen, and speed settings buttons.  Things were already starting to seem like a very different game.<\/p>\n<p>First, it was time to upgrade the audio.  Pop Them Balloons had three main songs, a title theme, a credits theme, and a game theme.  I&#8217;m going to upgrade that to five songs for Can&#8217;t Stop: a title theme, a credits theme, and three game themes.  I updated the code to change the game theme depending on the difficulty selected, that way you can have a more casual experience on more casual game modes.<\/p>\n<p>And here I ran into my first creative editing situation.  I felt the &#8216;game over&#8217; theme from HalyconFalconX would make for a great title them on Can&#8217;t Stop The Rock&#8230; Except for the inclusion of &#8220;Fail!&#8221; at the end of the song.  Not to worry, I opened up Audacity (my favorite open source MP3 editor) and clipped it out of the waveform.  That&#8217;s the sort of thing you can do with open content.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/audacity.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/audacity.png\" alt=\"audacity\" width=\"793\" height=\"644\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5514\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/audacity.png 793w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/audacity-300x243.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I wanted the action to be fast and furious, so I went with high BPM tracks and removed some graphical flourishes for now.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"700\" height=\"525\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/dBl-0xNH544?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>From here I updated the background to pulsate through a known list of pleasant colors, and updated the little rock hero to actually pop some balloons as it crossed them.

All this time, I had assumed from the box art and gameplay screens it was a simple 2d side-scroller.

Oh no, it\u2019s not a bad game, not at all. It\u2019s a great game. It improves upon the original in many ways. And yet, I rate it slightly below the original. It\u2019s the rare case of an excellent sequal to an excellent game being somehow better and yet worse than the original.\n\n[![277890_screenshots_2014-07-16_00094](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-16_00094.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-16_00094.jpg)\n\nThe original Shantae was a terrific (if a bit backtracky) metroid-vania for the Game Boy Color. It was a technical feat and a stand-out on the now ancient handheld. It presented us with a colorful and unique cast of characters in an interesting world. Risky\u2019s Revenge brings all of that back to the sequel. It\u2019s well drawn, the sprites are colorful, and the gameplay is oh so tight. Excellent controls are a highlight of the series and Risky\u2019s Revenge delights with classic platforming sections and even a side-scrolling shooter throwback.\n\n[![277890_screenshots_2014-12-23_00006](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-12-23_00006.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-12-23_00006.jpg)\n\nAnd then it\u2019s over. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a four hour game, especially one of this caliber. It just doesn\u2019t feel as fleshed out as the original. The plot is similar, but you end up getting fewer dance transformations, and there are fewer collectibles. There\u2019s only one real town as compared to the multiple towns in the original, leaving the game world feeling a bit smaller for it.\n\n[![277890_screenshots_2014-07-18_00003](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-18_00003.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-18_00003.jpg)\n\nThankfully, there is also less backtracking than in the original. Risky\u2019s Revenge immediately gives you access to warp points without gating them behind collectible quests, and the game is better for it. In fact, every aspect of the game has been tightened up in some way. The transformation mechanics are simpler, the world is easier to traverse, the enemies are more colorful. It\u2019s an excellent game\u2026 it\u2019s just shorter than I\u2019d hoped.\n\n[![277890_screenshots_2015-02-11_00001](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2015-02-11_00001.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2015-02-11_00001.jpg)\n\nRicky\u2019s Revenge is four hours of fun. It is filled with tight platforming, a fun and irreverent sense of humor and classic visuals. An easy recommendation at 10$, I give the second in the Shantae trilogy a 88\/100. An excellent platforming adventure that\u2019s just a little short.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Shantae: Risky&#8217;s Revenge is a bit of an aberration.  Oh no, it&#8217;s not a bad game, not at all.

It&#8217;s the rare case of an excellent sequal to an excellent game being somehow better and yet worse than the original.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-16_00094.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-16_00094.jpg\" alt=\"277890_screenshots_2014-07-16_00094\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5573\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-16_00094.jpg 1366w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-16_00094-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-16_00094-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-16_00094-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The original Shantae was a terrific (if a bit backtracky) metroid-vania for the Game Boy Color.  It was a technical feat and a stand-out on the now ancient handheld.  It presented us with a colorful and unique cast of characters in an interesting world.  Risky&#8217;s Revenge brings all of that back to the sequel.  It&#8217;s well drawn, the sprites are colorful, and the gameplay is oh so tight.  Excellent controls are a highlight of the series and Risky&#8217;s Revenge delights with classic platforming sections and even a side-scrolling shooter throwback.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-12-23_00006.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-12-23_00006.jpg\" alt=\"277890_screenshots_2014-12-23_00006\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5574\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-12-23_00006.jpg 1440w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-12-23_00006-300x188.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-12-23_00006-1024x640.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And then it&#8217;s over.  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with a four hour game, especially one of this caliber.  It just doesn&#8217;t feel as fleshed out as the original.  The plot is similar, but you end up getting fewer dance transformations, and there are fewer collectibles.  There&#8217;s only one real town as compared to the multiple towns in the original, leaving the game world feeling a bit smaller for it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-18_00003.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-18_00003.jpg\" alt=\"277890_screenshots_2014-07-18_00003\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5575\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-18_00003.jpg 1920w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-18_00003-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-18_00003-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-18_00003-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, there is also less backtracking than in the original.  Risky&#8217;s Revenge immediately gives you access to warp points without gating them behind collectible quests, and the game is better for it.  In fact, every aspect of the game has been tightened up in some way.  The transformation mechanics are simpler, the world is easier to traverse, the enemies are more colorful.  It&#8217;s an excellent game&#8230; it&#8217;s just shorter than I&#8217;d hoped.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2015-02-11_00001.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2015-02-11_00001.jpg\" alt=\"277890_screenshots_2015-02-11_00001\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5576\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2015-02-11_00001.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2015-02-11_00001-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Ricky&#8217;s Revenge is four hours of fun.  It is filled with tight platforming, a fun and irreverent sense of humor and classic visuals.  An easy recommendation at 10$, I give the second in the Shantae trilogy a 88\/100.  An excellent platforming adventure that&#8217;s just a little short.<\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/277890_screenshots_2014-07-16_00094.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 05:48:17 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 01:08:38 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 05:48:17 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":5580,"title":"JSON Resume Viewer for Android","slug":"resume-json-viewer-for-android","markdown":"\nJSON Resume Viewer is a native Android application for viewing resume.JSON files natively on Android devices.\n\nYou can find out more about resume.JSON at:  \n https:\/\/jsonresume.org\/\n\nDownload directly from the Google Play Store at:  \n https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hunterdavis.jsonresumeviewer\n\nFeatures:  \n 1.

It was by far my most popular series of articles, and the porting work I did is still used by a few die-hard fans.

This is a wonderful time.\n\nHowever, people still miss the Zipit. I still field emails looking for old drivers or OS images in 2015. There was just something so right about a portable linux box with a real keyboard. No keyboard-equipped cell phone ever replaced it for me, and let\u2019s be honest. The keyboard on the Z2 was terrible, and the software was closed source. It\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll ever see a new Zipit, and even if we did it wouldn\u2019t be as open as we\u2019d like.\n\nSo color me very surprised when I was forwarded a very interesting Kickstarter project around an embedded system on a chip called (fittingly) [CHIP](https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/1598272670\/chip-the-worlds-first-9-computer\/). At the basic pledge level, it\u2019s a 9$ 1ghz SoC that can run linux and has wifi. Nothing too crazy, but certainly 4x faster than the original Z2, and plenty fast for many uses.

And wouldn\u2019t you know it, this \u201cdocking station\u201d has a physical keyboard, 5 hour battery, and looks very much like an unfolded Zipit. Add in the fact that this is open source hardware, and you\u2019ve pretty much ticked off all the boxes in my \u2018must buy\u2019 list.\n\nWill this Kickstarter be able to deliver on it\u2019s promises? Who knows, and I suppose I\u2019m the fool once again for backing a product at full retail price.

It supports Java and Gradle, so my first project to add was an Android game collection I wrote: [Can\u2019t Stop The Rock](https:\/\/github.com\/huntergdavis\/cantstoptherock).\n\nThe first thing to note is that the code intelligence feature needs to be able to correctly execute your gradle scripts. That means upgrading your local gradle binaries to 1.7 or above if you\u2019re using any jcenter libraries. Head on over to [gradle.org](http:\/\/gradle.org\/) for that, then start the [Sourcegraph install script](https:\/\/src.sourcegraph.com\/sourcegraph\/.docs\/install\/) for your system.\n\nAfter installation, you\u2019ll need to add your server\u2019s IP address to the config file. In my case, I only wanted it available while I was remote\u2019d into my development machine, so I chose 127.0.0.1 (localhost.) My config file is therefore:\n\n```\n[serve]<br><\/br>\nAppURL = http:\/\/127.0.0.1<br><\/br>\nHTTPAddr = :80<br><\/br>```\n\nNow that your server is up and running, head to the IP address you entered above and set up your first user. You can then create a repository using the command line, in my case:\n\n` src --endpoint=http:\/\/127.0.0.1 repo create CantStopTheRock`\n\nFrom there, it\u2019s as simple as adding the sourcegraph server above as a remote host in your git project, like so:\n\n` git remote add sourcegraph http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/CantStopTheRock<br><\/br>`\n\nNow simply push a branch up to your new \u201csourcegraph\u201d host:\n\n` git push -u sourcegraph master`\n\nAnd you\u2019re in business! Now you can browse to the IP address above in your browser and see your source repository. As I said before, it\u2019s VERY much like GitHub, but I do find myself quite impressed with the source intelligence feature. One of the great things about the distributed nature of git is that you can push your projects around to various servers without any concern, and the idea that one could have many micro-services each reading and executing from git repositories is quite interesting indeed!\n\n\n","html":"<p>As I was reading my daily news articles the other day, I came upon a fascinating piece of <a href=\"https:\/\/fair.io\/\">oddly-licensed<\/a> software: <a href=\"https:\/\/src.sourcegraph.com\/sourcegraph\">Sourcegraph<\/a>.

Final Fantasy XIII-2 falls victim to the same trap as Kingdom Hearts 3D: sequel one-up syndrome.\n\n[![4eeaebab_Final-Fantasy-XIII-2-Screenshot-21](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/4eeaebab_Final-Fantasy-XIII-2-Screenshot-21.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/4eeaebab_Final-Fantasy-XIII-2-Screenshot-21.jpg)\n\nYou see, Kingdom Hearts 3D, being the (10th?) in the series had a lot to live up to. Ten games of varying gameplay styles all chock full of storyline and game mechanics. As a game designer, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking this is what your audience wants, as Kingdom Hearts is a multinational best-selling phenomenon. So when you\u2019re crafting up this awesome sequel, nothing is off limits. Fans want a card game? Add a card game. Fans want Pokemon? Add monster collecting. Fans love Monster Hunter? Add monster hunting quests.\n\n[![5996110800_event06_usrgb](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/5996110800_event06_usrgb.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/5996110800_event06_usrgb.jpg)\n\nSo it was with Kingdom Hearts 3D, and so it is with Final Fantasy XIII-2 (abbreviated 13-2 from here on.) Pokemon, monster hunter, IQ (intelligent Qube), and previous Final Fantasy games all add their own flavor to this gaming jambalaya.\n\nOne of the major complaints about Final Fantasy 13 was it\u2019s linear nature. You literally didn\u2019t get a single side-quest until 20 hours into the game, and only then do you realize that all of the side-quests are literally contained within this single area. 13-2 solves this by making the game seem non-linear through time travel: you choose your locations through time from a large grid. In reality this is to cover up the huge amount of backtracking that occurs though the relatively small game world.\n\n[![Final-Fantasy-13-2-PS3-Screenshot-6-500x281](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Final-Fantasy-13-2-PS3-Screenshot-6-500x281.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Final-Fantasy-13-2-PS3-Screenshot-6-500x281.jpg)\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating concept, in theory. You play as time traveling pokemon adventurers (oh yes, they added monster collecting\/fighting into this one.) Each level has multiple time periods associated with it, as well as multiple alternate timelines. Unfortunately, these \u201calternate timeline\u201d levels all share the same map, and this only serves to make the game more of a grind.  \n And it is a grind. You\u2019ve only two main characters in your party, with the third character slot taken up by your pokemon. These are always the same two characters, so be sure you like them. They\u2019re all you get. While adventuring, you\u2019re introduced to level bosses earlier than you\u2019re ready to handle them, so you\u2019ll need to backtrack and grind levels before each major confrontation. After ten to twenty hours of gameplay you\u2019ve literally seen 99% of the maps in this game, with one particularly frustrating puzzle level saved for the last boss. (seriously, jumping puzzles?)\n\nYou\u2019re also constantly searching for hidden objects, using an annoying mog-throwing minigame mechanism that detracts from gameplay. Honestly though, I really enjoyed this aspect of the game. Not because it was fun! Oh no! The mog that follows your team around is annoying as hell, and this hidden object game gives you the chance to continually throw the little bastard off of cliffs.\n\nI\u2019ll say this about the modern Final Fantasy games, they know how to stretch for time. Thirty or forty hours into the game I realized I hadn\u2019t even scratched the surface of the chocobo racing league, or the chocobo breeding program, or the gambling machines, or the extra sidequests from finding hidden collectibles.\n\n[![2](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2.jpg)\n\nThat\u2019s not to say this isn\u2019t a fun game. 13-2 is a Final Fantasy game after all, and you can expect a certain level of polish and twists on RPG mechanics from from any of them. This is just the kind of fun where you need to know exactly what you enjoy. I didn\u2019t miss the time I would have spent racing chocobos, nor did I have any trouble questing without the endless hidden object collectible rewards. Though they are purported to be major portions of the game, I wasn\u2019t interested, and 13-2 let me remain that way.\n\nIn a way, that\u2019s part of the appeal of a sprawling RPG: the opportunity to dive deep on interesting gameplay, and skim over the less enjoyable portions. And though after a year I never feel like 13-2 grabbed me in the way Fallout 4 did, I did enjoy the time spent questing and leveling and throwing that stupid mog over cliffs.\n\nI rate Final Fantasy XIII-2 70\/100, with high marks for the mog-throwing schadenfreude.\n\n\n","html":"<p>13 months ago I published my review of Final Fantasy XIII.

Thirty or forty hours into the game I realized I hadn&#8217;t even scratched the surface of the chocobo racing league, or the chocobo breeding program, or the gambling machines, or the extra sidequests from finding hidden collectibles. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2.jpg\" alt=\"2\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5677\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say this isn&#8217;t a fun game.  13-2 is a Final Fantasy game after all, and you can expect a certain level of polish and twists on RPG mechanics from from any of them.  This is just the kind of fun where you need to know exactly what you enjoy.  I didn&#8217;t miss the time I would have spent racing chocobos, nor did I have any trouble questing without the endless hidden object collectible rewards.  Though they are purported to be major portions of the game, I wasn&#8217;t interested, and 13-2 let me remain that way.<\/p>\n<p>In a way, that&#8217;s part of the appeal of a sprawling RPG: the opportunity to dive deep on interesting gameplay, and skim over the less enjoyable portions.  And though after a year I never feel like 13-2 grabbed me in the way Fallout 4 did, I did enjoy the time spent questing and leveling and throwing that stupid mog over cliffs.<\/p>\n<p>I rate Final Fantasy XIII-2 70\/100, with high marks for the mog-throwing schadenfreude.<\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/5998mooglethrow_b02_us_rgb-psd_.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Tue, 01 Dec 2015 01:45:21 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 21:48:28 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 01 Dec 2015 01:45:21 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":5686,"title":"Emotional Gaming: Fallout 4 vs. Ori and the Blind Forest","slug":"emotional-gaming-fallout-4-vs-ori-and-the-blind-forest","markdown":"\nI spent almost 100 hours playing through Fallout 4, and easily spent an additional 20 watching a friend play.

Sure, it says Final Fantasy on the box. Sure, it\u2019s got all of the characters from the last 2 games, and even some of the mechanics. Wow though, I mean wow. What the hell did I just play?\n\n[![lr_12222012_02](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lr_12222012_02.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lr_12222012_02.jpg)\n\nAfter the Pokemon style mechanics of the last game, I was ready for anything. Anything is just what I got. You find yourself acting as a literal Jesus, saving souls for a robot god in the sky. The gameplay embraces this mythos whole-heartedly. You\u2019re 13 days from the end of the world, and it\u2019s your job to save as many souls as possible. This means, almost without fail, that you\u2019ll be collecting items dropped by monsters scattered throughout the world. That and clothes shopping. The few times you\u2019re not out literally committing genocide (more on this later), you\u2019re collecting items dropped by the NPCs whose souls you\u2019re trying to save. Following? Let me break it down for you, you\u2019ll be backtracking and grinding and changing clothes.\n\n[![index](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/index.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/index.jpg)\n\nThis is an odd sort of grinding though. Abilities are found by killing monsters, as is gold. You never \u201clevel up\u201d. Your health and action points are determined by the clothes you\u2019re wearing, and your base points. In a typical Japanese style RPG, you\u2019d be steadily gaining levels, health, and action points by earning experience and killing monsters. It\u2019s a tried a true formula: kill monsters, earn experience, level up, repeat. Final Fantasy 13-3 chucks that right out the window. You directly earn health and ability points through saving souls. This means completing quests is the most direct way to \u201clevel\u201d your character. It\u2019s an odd choice for a Final Fantasy game, but in weird way it kind of works. You\u2019ll still be grinding though, big time. You just won\u2019t be grinding for heath and XP. You\u2019ll be grinding for time, and item drops. Oh, and genocide.\n\n[![gaming-lightning-returns-screenshot-14.1356634537](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gaming-lightning-returns-screenshot-14.1356634537.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gaming-lightning-returns-screenshot-14.1356634537.jpg)\n\nYeah, genocide. As you\u2019re playing a Jesus figure at the end of the world, a lot of morally questionable options become available to you. One of them is to literally wipe out every last creature of every single species of wild animal on earth. All of them. In some cases this is just a few, in most cases it\u2019s many dozens or hundreds. In one case it\u2019s over sixty thousand. As you don\u2019t get experience for killing these monsters (just item drops,) if you wish to complete this quest you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time just murdering monsters for the sake of it. That\u2019s pretty grim, and the very definition of grinding. Again though, it kind of works. It also opens up some fresh possibilities, especially in the end game. In most RPGs, you never run out of monsters. Ever. So even at level 9999 with all your stats maxed, walking across the land is still an exercise in tedium and pointless battles. This game gives you the option, however tedious, of completely wiping out the monsters in your favorite haunts. With a little time invested, you can have a monster-free experience while saving those last few souls.\n\n[![gfs_278120_2_5](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gfs_278120_2_5.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gfs_278120_2_5.jpg)\n\nYou\u2019ll also earn a hell of a lot of cash while you\u2019re out there eradicating entire species. This is perfect for buying just the right kind of outfit for your fighting style. As you play one character (eponymous fan favorite Lightning,) you\u2019ll be buying clothes just for her. During battle you switch from a set of three main outfits, each that you\u2019ve previously filled with moves and spells and just the right sword to match that dress. There\u2019s a surprising depth to the clothing (armor) system in this game. At first glance it seems like just another \u201cdress up your character\u201d type minigame, but it\u2019s actually the primary mechanism for customizing your play style. Sure there are the cheesecake bikini costumes that fanboys and fangirls gravitate towards, but there are also the throwback retro costumes from previous games, costumes from enemies, furry costumes, animatronic ears and tails and all sorts of things that would feel right at home at your nearest anime convention.\n\n[![Lighting-Returns-Outfits](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Lighting-Returns-Outfits.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Lighting-Returns-Outfits.jpg)\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not like this is an excellent game.

Sure, it says Final Fantasy on the box.  Sure, it&#8217;s got all of the characters from the last 2 games, and even some of the mechanics.  Wow though, I mean wow.  What the hell did I just play?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lr_12222012_02.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5728\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lr_12222012_02.jpg\" alt=\"lr_12222012_02\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5728\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lr_12222012_02.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lr_12222012_02-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lr_12222012_02-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lr_12222012_02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lr_12222012_02-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>After the Pokemon style mechanics of the last game, I was ready for anything.  Anything is just what I got.  You find yourself acting as a literal Jesus, saving souls for a robot god in the sky.  The gameplay embraces this mythos whole-heartedly.  You&#8217;re 13 days from the end of the world, and it&#8217;s your job to save as many souls as possible.  This means, almost without fail, that you&#8217;ll be collecting items dropped by monsters scattered throughout the world.  That and clothes shopping.  The few times you&#8217;re not out literally committing genocide (more on this later), you&#8217;re collecting items dropped by the NPCs whose souls you&#8217;re trying to save. Following?  Let me break it down for you, you&#8217;ll be backtracking and grinding and changing clothes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/index.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5726\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/index.jpg\" alt=\"index\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1050\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5726\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/index.jpg 1680w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/index-300x188.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/index-768x480.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/index-1024x640.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This is an odd sort of grinding though.  Abilities are found by killing monsters, as is gold.  You never &#8220;level up&#8221;.  Your health and action points are determined by the clothes you&#8217;re wearing, and your base points.  In a typical Japanese style RPG, you&#8217;d be steadily gaining levels, health, and action points by earning experience and killing monsters.  It&#8217;s a tried a true formula: kill monsters, earn experience, level up, repeat.  Final Fantasy 13-3 chucks that right out the window.  You directly earn health and ability points through saving souls.  This means completing quests is the most direct way to &#8220;level&#8221; your character.  It&#8217;s an odd choice for a Final Fantasy game, but in weird way it kind of works.  You&#8217;ll still be grinding though, big time.  You just won&#8217;t be grinding for heath and XP.  You&#8217;ll be grinding for time, and item drops.  Oh, and genocide.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gaming-lightning-returns-screenshot-14.1356634537.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5724\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gaming-lightning-returns-screenshot-14.1356634537.jpg\" alt=\"gaming-lightning-returns-screenshot-14.1356634537\" width=\"618\" height=\"348\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5724\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gaming-lightning-returns-screenshot-14.1356634537.jpg 618w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gaming-lightning-returns-screenshot-14.1356634537-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gaming-lightning-returns-screenshot-14.1356634537-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, genocide.  As you&#8217;re playing a Jesus figure at the end of the world, a lot of morally questionable options become available to you.  One of them is to literally wipe out every last creature of every single species of wild animal on earth.  All of them.  In some cases this is just a few, in most cases it&#8217;s many dozens or hundreds.  In one case it&#8217;s over sixty thousand.  As you don&#8217;t get experience for killing these monsters (just item drops,) if you wish to complete this quest you&#8217;ll be spending a lot of time just murdering monsters for the sake of it.  That&#8217;s pretty grim, and the very definition of grinding.  Again though, it kind of works.  It also opens up some fresh possibilities, especially in the end game.  In most RPGs, you never run out of monsters.  Ever.  So even at level 9999 with all your stats maxed, walking across the land is still an exercise in tedium and pointless battles.  This game gives you the option, however tedious, of completely wiping out the monsters in your favorite haunts.  With a little time invested, you can have a monster-free experience while saving those last few souls.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gfs_278120_2_5.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5725\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gfs_278120_2_5.jpg\" alt=\"gfs_278120_2_5\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5725\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gfs_278120_2_5.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gfs_278120_2_5-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gfs_278120_2_5-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/gfs_278120_2_5-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also earn a hell of a lot of cash while you&#8217;re out there eradicating entire species.  This is perfect for buying just the right kind of outfit for your fighting style.  As you play one character (eponymous fan favorite Lightning,) you&#8217;ll be buying clothes just for her.  During battle you switch from a set of three main outfits, each that you&#8217;ve previously filled with moves and spells and just the right sword to match that dress.  There&#8217;s a surprising depth to the clothing (armor) system in this game.  At first glance it seems like just another &#8220;dress up your character&#8221; type minigame, but it&#8217;s actually the primary mechanism for customizing your play style.  Sure there are the cheesecake bikini costumes that fanboys and fangirls gravitate towards, but there are also the throwback retro costumes from previous games, costumes from enemies, furry costumes, animatronic ears and tails and all sorts of things that would feel right at home at your nearest anime convention.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Lighting-Returns-Outfits.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5727\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Lighting-Returns-Outfits.jpg\" alt=\"Lighting-Returns-Outfits\" width=\"939\" height=\"391\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5727\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Lighting-Returns-Outfits.jpg 939w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Lighting-Returns-Outfits-300x125.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Lighting-Returns-Outfits-768x320.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I mean, it&#8217;s not like this is an excellent game.

You\u2019re in there fighting from the first minute to the last, with a constant stream of upgrades and fun weapons, each with two operating modes. They feel balanced, and the entire experience comes off as a series of incredibly balanced multiplayer maps. These maps are filled with enemies and strung together with a bit of story and cool graphics. That is, in retrospect, more true to the original Doom than Doom 3 was.\n\n[![download (1)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download-1.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download-1.jpg)\n\nYou see, I almost built a new PC for this new DHOOOM!!!1! Ever since Doom 2 I\u2019ve been upgrading my PC in order to play the newest edition of Doom. When Doom 3 came out in 2004, I was working at my first job as a programmer, and was blown away by the incredible graphics of the upcoming Doom 3. I built myself a monster gaming PC just to play it, and I was not disappointed. It was a paced, excellent horror experience with a fun bit of action and a bit of boss battle. It pushed graphics cards to their limits and really set the standard for PC graphics at the time. It wasn\u2019t particularly fast though, especially with the stealth and \u201cwhy can\u2019t I use my flashlight with my gun\u201d sections.\n\n[![download](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download.jpg)\n\nFast forward to this weekend, and I\u2019m looking at the system requirements for DOOM2016. I\u2019m feeling under-powered with an i3 3430 and a Radeon 8750, both below the bare minimum specs. I give it a try though, and am taken aback as everything looked great and played silky smooth! I guess the age when Doom needed a graphics card or CPU made in the past 4 years is over.\n\n[![379720_screenshots_20160514001940_1](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/379720_screenshots_20160514001940_1.jpg)](http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/379720_screenshots_20160514001940_1.jpg)\n\nSpeed or not, at the end of the day Doom cost me full retail and delivered a 13 hour experience that I enjoyed greatly. In hindsight, I would have waited for a better sale or the first price drop before I dove in. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the game performed on my 4-year old PC, as well as the old-school mechanics and aesthetics from the Quake 3 era. I rate Doom (2016) an 85\/100, an excellent throwback to the FPS games of yore, and a rock-solid (if brief at 13 hours) shooter for the modern era.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Doooooooooom!

That is, in retrospect, more true to the original Doom than Doom 3 was.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5737\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download-1.jpg\" alt=\"download (1)\" width=\"2048\" height=\"864\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5737\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download-1.jpg 2048w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download-1-300x127.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download-1-768x324.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download-1-1024x432.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You see, I almost built a new PC for this new DHOOOM!!!1!  Ever since Doom 2 I&#8217;ve been upgrading my PC in order to play the newest edition of Doom.  When Doom 3 came out in 2004, I was working at my first job as a programmer, and was blown away by the incredible graphics of the upcoming Doom 3.  I built myself a monster gaming PC just to play it, and I was not disappointed.  It was a paced, excellent horror experience with a fun bit of action and a bit of boss battle.  It pushed graphics cards to their limits and really set the standard for PC graphics at the time.  It wasn&#8217;t particularly fast though, especially with the stealth and &#8220;why can&#8217;t I use my flashlight with my gun&#8221; sections.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5738\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download.jpg\" alt=\"download\" width=\"2048\" height=\"582\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5738\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download.jpg 2048w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download-300x85.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download-768x218.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/download-1024x291.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Fast forward to this weekend, and I&#8217;m looking at the system requirements for DOOM2016.  I&#8217;m feeling under-powered with an i3 3430 and a Radeon 8750, both below the bare minimum specs.  I give it a try though, and am taken aback as everything looked great and played silky smooth!  I guess the age when Doom needed a graphics card or CPU made in the past 4 years is over.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/379720_screenshots_20160514001940_1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5736\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/379720_screenshots_20160514001940_1.jpg\" alt=\"379720_screenshots_20160514001940_1\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5736\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/379720_screenshots_20160514001940_1.jpg 1366w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/379720_screenshots_20160514001940_1-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/379720_screenshots_20160514001940_1-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/379720_screenshots_20160514001940_1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/379720_screenshots_20160514001940_1-460x260.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Speed or not, at the end of the day Doom cost me full retail and delivered a 13 hour experience that I enjoyed greatly.  In hindsight, I would have waited for a better sale or the first price drop before I dove in.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well the game performed on my 4-year old PC, as well as the old-school mechanics and aesthetics from the Quake 3 era.  I rate Doom (2016) an 85\/100, an excellent throwback to the FPS games of yore, and a rock-solid (if brief at 13 hours) shooter for the modern era.  <\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/www.hunterdavis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/379720_screenshots_20160514001940_1.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 16 May 2016 00:10:27 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 16 May 2016 00:12:45 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 16 May 2016 00:10:27 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":5746,"title":"(Review) One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 (Vita)","slug":"review-one-piece-pirate-warriors-3-vita","markdown":"\nYep, a Vita review.

It was also great playing through the next ten years of One Piece that I hadn\u2019t read. The over-the top battle animations and zany characters were fun at first, but could quickly become tedious if you play in long stretches. That\u2019s the running theme here.
